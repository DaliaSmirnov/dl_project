12,I did that one time.,Ted
13,It was a blazer!,Barney
14,"You know, ever since college it's been Marshall and Lily and me. Now it's going to be Marshall and Lily... and me. They'll get married, start a family-before long I'm the weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call &quot;Uncle Ted&quot;.",Ted
15,I see what this is about. Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met?,Barney
16,"Ted, I'm going to teach you how to live. (Ted's shocked) Barney, we met at the urinal.",Barney
17,"Oh, right. Hi.",Ted
18,"Lesson one, lose the goatee. It doesn't look good with your suit.",Barney
19,I'm not wearing a suit.,Ted

21,"Thirty, right. You're right. I guess it's just, you're best friend gets engaged-you start thinking about that stuff.",Ted
22,"I thought I was your best friend. Ted, say I'm your best friend.",Barney
23,"You're my best friend, Barney.",Ted
24,"Good! And as your best friend, I suggest we play a little game called... &quot;Have you met Ted?&quot;",Barney
25,"Wai-no, no, no. We're not playing &quot;Have You Met Ted?&quot;",Ted
26,"(Taps a woman names Yasmine) Hi, have you met Ted? (Leaves and watches from a distance).",Barney
27,"(To Yasmine) Hi, I'm Ted.",Ted
28,It's a very pretty name.,Ted
29,Hey!,Marshall
30,"Urgh. I'm exhausted. It was finger painting day at school, and a five year old boy (takes coat off revealing a purple hand print on her right breast) got to second base with me. Wow, you're cooking?",Lily
31,"Yes, I am.",Marshall
32,Aww-(They kiss) Are you sure that's a good idea after last time? You looked really creepy without eyebrows.,Lily

34,So there's more surprises? Like what?,Lily
35,BOOGITY BOO! And that's all of them! I'm goanna go... cook. (Leaves),Marshall
36,"I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am. I just couldn't imagine settling down right now.",Ted
37,"Well maybe eventually. Some fall day. Possibly in Central Park. Simple ceremony, we'll write our own vows. But--eh--no DJ, people will dance. I'm not going to worry about it! Damn it, why did Marshall have to get engaged? (Yasmine laughs) Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh?",Ted
38,"Well, you're clearly drunk (pulls her wine glass away. Hold up glass to bartender) ONE MORE FOR THE LADY!",Ted
39,"Okay, look what I got (runs to the fridge. Takes out wine bottle)",Marshall
40,Aw-honey. Champagne! (hands it to Marshall),Lily
41,(after short silence) Yeah. (hands it back),Marshall
42,"(realizing) No, you are too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne!",Lily
43,I'm not scared.,Marshall
44,Then open it!,Lily
45,Fine (takes bottle. Looks at it for a couple of seconds) Please open it (hands it to Lily),Marshall
46,"You are unbelievable, Marshall. No-(Scene splits in half and shows both Lily and Marshall on top arguing and Ted and Yasmine on the bottom mingling)",Lily

53,"No, but dibs. Where's that champagne? I wanna drink a toast with my fiancÃ©.",Marshall
54,aww (claps. They kiss),Lily
55,"I don't know why I was so scared of this. Pretty easy right? (Pops cork, hit's Lily's eye)",Marshall
56,(YELLS),Lily

58,Why am I freaking out all of a sudden? This is crazy! I'm not ready to settle down.,Ted
59,(ignoring) how does Carl land a Lebanese girl?,Barney
60,It's always been &quot;don't even think about it till you're thirty&quot;,Ted
61,Exactly-the guy doesn't even own a suit!,Barney
62,"Plus Marshall's found the love of his life. Even if I was ready, which I'm not, but if I was it's like, &quot;Okay, I'm ready! Where is she?&quot; (Spots Robin)",Ted
63,"Hey Barney, see that girl?",Ted
64,"(to Robin) Hey, have you met Ted?",Barney

66,"I'm sorry, Lily. I'm so sorry. Take us to the hospital.",Marshall
67,"Hit me? Please, this guy could barely even spank me in bed for fun. He's all like, (hits ice in bag using to cover eye) &quot;Oh, did that hurt?&quot; and I'm like, &quot;Come on, let me have it you pansy!&quot; (realizes) Wow, complete stranger.",Lily
68,So what do you do?,Ted
69,I'm a reporter for Metro News 1.,Robin
70,(nods) Oh.,Ted
71,"Well, kind of a reporter. I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news, you know. Like-um-monkey that can play the ukulele. I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon.",Robin
72,"Bigger like, uh, gorilla with an up-right bass? Sorry, you're really pretty. (Robin laughs and waves to her friends) Oh, your friends don't seem too happy.",Ted
73,"Yeah, see the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend so tonight every guy is... &quot;The enemy&quot;.",Robin
74,You know if you don't make your friend feel better you could throw a drink at my face. I don't mind.,Ted
75,She would love that! It does look fun in the movies.,Robin
76,"Hey, you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?",Ted
77,"Oh, I can't. I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday. Some guys attempting to make a big (cut) so my news is covering it.",Robin
78,That's going to take a week?,Ted
79,"Yeah, he's going to eat it too, it's another record.",Robin
80,"Uh, I know this is a long sh*t, but how about tomorrow night?",Ted

92,"Mom, dad, I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby! Marshall, how have I always described my perfect woman?",Ted

94,I've got five dogs.,Robin
95,...she drinks scotch?,Marshall
96,I love a scotch that's old enough to order its own scotch.,Robin
97,Can quote obscure lines from &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;?,Marshall
98,"Ray, when someone asks you if you're a god you say, &quot;Yes!&quot;",Robin
99,And I'm saving the best for last.,Ted
100,Do you want these? (Holding up remaining olives from her plate) I hate olives.,Robin
101,She hates olives! Awesome!,Marshall
102,The olive theory.,Lily
103,"The olive theory is based on my friends, Marshall and Lily. He hates olives, she loves them. In a weird way that's what makes them such a great couple. A Perfect balance (eats olive).",Ted
104,"You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever.",Robin
105,(flirting) I can take them off your hands.,Ted
106,(flirting back) they're all yours.,Robin
107,"Oh, it is on! It is on (imitates robot) till the break of dawn.",Marshall
108,"wait, it's only the break of ten-thirty. What happened?",Lily
109,"I've gotta get one of those blue French horns for over my fireplace. It's gotta be blue, it's gotta be French.",Robin
110,No Green Clarinet?,Ted

115,Yeah.,Ted
116,So? Did you kiss her?,Marshall
117,"No. The moment wasn't right. (They sigh) Look, this woman could be my future wife; I want our first kiss to be amazing.",Ted
118,"Aww, Ted that's so sweet. So you chickened out like the little bitch.",Lily
119,What? I did not chicken out! You know what? I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate who hasn't been single since the first week of college.,Ted
120,"Ted, anyone who's single would tell you the same thing. Even the dumbest single person alive, and if you don't believe me...call him.",Lily
121,"(Phone) Hey loser, how's not playing laser tag? Because playing laser tag is awesome! Oh, I k*ll you Connor; don't make me get your mom!",Barney
122,"Hey, listen. I need your opinion on something.",Ted
123,"Okay, meet me at the bar in fifteen minutes-AND SUIT UP!",Barney
124,So these guys think I chickened out. What do you think?,Ted
125,I can't believe you're still not wearing a SUIT!,Barney

130,"No! (To Lily) I didn't, I swear.",Marshall
131,"But see-at least, tonight, I get to sleep knowing, Marshall and Me... never going to happen. You should've kissed her.",Barney
132,"Urgh, I should've kissed her. What about when she gets back from Orlando?",Ted
133,A week? That's like-a year in hot girl time. She'll forget all about you. Mark my words: you will never see that one again.,Barney
134,There she is...,Ted
135,"Ooo. She's cute! (To Carl) Hey Carl, turn it up!",Lily
136,"(on TV)...persuaded him to reconsider at which point the man came down off the ledge, giving this bizarre story a happy ending. Reporting from",Robin
137,"Huh, guy didn't jump",Marshall
138,"(on TV) Metro One News, back to you bill.",Robin
139,I'm goanna go kiss her. Right now.,Ted
140,"Oh-Dude, it's midnight. As your future lawyer I'm goanna advise you: that's freakin' crazy!",Marshall
141,"I never do anything crazy! I'm always waiting for the moment! Planning the moment! Well she's leaving tomorrow this may be the only moment I'm goanna get! I gotta do what that guy couldn't, I gotta take the leap! Okay not a perfect metaphor, for me it's fall in love and get married-for him it's... death.",Ted
142,"Actually, that is a perfect metaphor. By the way, did I congratulate you two? (Raises glass to Lily and Marshall)",Barney
143,I'm doing this. (Starts to leave),Ted
144,Let's go (pulls Marshall up),Lily
145,Word up!,Marshall

155,"Kiss her, Ted. Kiss her good.",Lily

157,"Marshall, remember this night. When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech, you're goanna tell this story. (exits cab)",Ted
158,Why does he get to be the best man? (Shouts out) I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND!,Barney
159,I've got five dogs.,Robin
160,"Not good, not good, not good, not good.",Ted

170,The women hot there?,Barney
171,(Whispers to Marshall) Simple no would have sufficed. (To Ranjit) She's lovely.,Barney
172,"So, Ted. What brings you back to Brooklyn at one in the morning in a-suit.",Robin
173,I was just hoping to get those olives... that you said I could have.,Ted
174,Would you like those olives with some Gin and Vermouth?,Robin
175,Are you trying to get me drunk?,Ted
176,For starters (turns music on. Leaves to the kitchen),Robin
177,(Looks up and mouths) Thank you.,Ted
178,"So, Marshall. This &quot;Olive Theory&quot; based on you and Lily?",Barney

180,"You hate olives? Lily loves them, you can't stand them.",Barney
181,"Yeah, hate olives.",Marshall
182,"Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th Street, dish of olives-you had some. What up?",Barney
183,(looks around for sign of Lily) You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.,Marshall
184,I swear.,Barney
185,"On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad; Lily asked if she could have my olives. I said, &quot;Sure... I hate olives.&quot;",Marshall
186,But you like olives!,Barney
187,"Well, I was eighteen, okay? I was a virgin. Been waiting for my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives.",Marshall
188,"Marshall, I'm going to get you an early wedding present. Don't get married.",Barney

192,I think I'm in love with you.,Ted
193,What?,Robin
194,"Come on man, you said your stomach's been hurting, right? You know what that is! Hunger. You're hungry for experience. Hungry for something new. Hungry for olives. But you're too scared to do anything about it.",Barney
195,"Yeah, I'm scared, okay? But when I think about spending the rest of my life with Lily... committing forever, no other women (Lily appears behind Marshall in the open window) doesn't scare me at all. I'm marrying that girl. (Lily pops her head in from the window. Marshall turns around) Lily. Lily, I like olives.",Marshall
196,We'll make it work. (They kiss.),Lily
197,"So Orlando, you goanna hit Disney World?",Ted
198,You love me?,Robin
199,"Oh, god, I can't believe I said that. Why did I say that? Who says that? I should just go. (Gets up)",Ted
200,Hold on. (Gets up) Wait a minute. (Hands him Olives) Promised you these.,Robin
201,Olives. Thanks. I love you. What's wrong with me?,Ted
202,"Why are we still sitting here? Let's go! We can still make last call. What do you say Lil? (Pirate Accent) Yo, ho ho and a bottle o' rum? (Silence) 'Cuz you're a pirate...",Barney
203,"Okay, eye patch gone-(takes eye patch off and throws it at Barney) And we can't just abandon Ted. If it doesn't go well up there he's gonna need some support.",Lily
204,It's been like twenty minutes. You think they're doin' it?,Marshall
205,You think they're doing it in front of the dogs?,Barney
206,Doggie style. (Laughs),Marshall
207,I had this girl in college; she had a golden retriever-,Barney
208,"Okay, we can go to the bar, just stop talking.",Lily
209,Hit it Ranjit. (They drive off),Barney
210,"So when you tell this story to your friends, could you avoid the word &quot;psycho&quot;? I prefer...eccentric.",Ted
211,"Good night, psycho (smiles). (Ted sarcastically clutches heart. Realizes friends left him)",Robin
212,Great (before Robin closes the door) Umm... how do I get to the F Train?,Ted
213,"Oh, um-two blocks (comes out) that way (points) and take a right.",Robin
214,"(upset/tired) Thanks. (Walks down the steps. Robin begins to walk in) You know what? (Robin stops. Ted turns around). I'm done being single. I'm not good at it. Look, obviously you can't tell a woman you just met you love her. But... it sucks that you can't. I'll tell you something though, if a woman-not you... just some hypothetical woman-were to bare with me through all this. I think I'd make a damn good husband. Because that's the stuff I'd be good at. Stuff like making her laugh and being a good father... and walking her five hypothetical dogs. Being a good kisser.",Ted
215,Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.,Robin
216,"Oh, I've got references.",Ted
217,"Good night, Ted. (Shake hands.)",Robin
218,And I'm a good hand shaker,Ted
219,that's a pretty great hand shake. (Looks him in the eyes),Robin
220,"And that was it, probably never see her again. (Silence) What?",Ted
221,That was the signal!,Marshall
222,That long lingering handshake-you should've kissed her!,Lily
223,There's no such thing as the signal. But yeah-that was the signal.,Barney
224,Carl!? (turns to friends) You guys weren't there.,Ted
225,I am so turned on right now.,Lily
226,"Guys, trust me. I've seen the signal. That was not the signal.",Ted
227,"Yeah Ted, we're not on you anymore.",Barney
228,(Toasting) To my fiancÃ©!,Marshall
229,(smiles) to the future!,Lily
230,That was not the signal!,Ted
231,"I suggest we play a little game I like to call, &quot;Have you Met Ted?&quot;",Barney
232,"No, no, no-we're not playing &quot;Have you Met Ted!&quot;",Ted
233,(Taps Robin's shoulder) Hi! Have you met Ted? (Leaves),Barney
234,I think I'm in love with you.,Ted
235,What?,Robin
236,"So you're not goanna call her? You went from, &quot;I think I'm in love with you&quot; to &quot;I'm not gonna call her?&quot;",Marshall
237,"I wasn't in love with her, okay? I was briefly in love with the abstract idea of getting married! That had absolutely nothing to do with Robin. (Finds Lily and Robin chatting at a table.) Robin!",Ted
238,Hey!,Robin
239,Look who I ran into!,Lily
240,Since when do you guys know each other?,Ted
241,"Uh... since about (points to glass) here. Lily recognized me from the news and-(Lily and Marshall kiss) Hello, Sailor!",Robin
242,They just got engaged.,Ted
243,"Well, I should get back to the station. See you guys. (Marshall raises a hand while still kissing Lily) Nice seeing you, Ted.",Robin
244,"Yeah, you too. (Robin leaves, Barney walks closer) Damn it.",Ted
245,What?,Lily
246,I'm in love with her.,Ted
247,(hits him) No! As your sponsor I will not let you relapse. You blew it; it's over-move on.,Barney
248,I don't know! I just have this feeling. She's the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.,Ted
249,"Lily, you squeaked?",Ted
250,"She said something about me didn't she? Come on, spill it, Red.",Ted
251,Fine!,Lily
252,So what do we think of Ted?,Lily
253,(laughs) Ted's something else.,Robin
254,"Huh... I'm gonna spin that as good. Lots of guys are &quot;something&quot;, I'm &quot;something else&quot;.",Ted
255,Comes on a little strong.,Robin
256,But...that's part of my charm.,Ted
257,But that's part of his charm.,Lily
258,"Oh, totally. I mean, he's sweet, he's charming, he's just looking for something a little bit more serious than I am. I mean the most I can handle right now is something casual. This just stays between us, right?",Robin
259,Are you kidding? This flapper-for knocks.,Lily
260,(shy) Oops...,Lily
261,"She wants casual. Okay, I'll be casual. I'm gonna be a mushroom cloud of casual. You know why? Cause it's a game! I wanted to skip to the end and do the &quot;happily ever after&quot; thing but you don't get there unless you play the game.",Ted
262,So're you gonna ask her out?,Marshall
263,"Yeah-No! I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out I'm asking her out. So how do I ask her out, without asking her out? (thinks)",Ted
264,Did you guys get high?,Lily
265,I got it! I don't ask her out... I invite her to our party next Friday.,Ted
266,We're having a party next Friday?,Marshall
267,We are now-Casual,Ted
268,"Yeah, cuz nothing says &quot;Casual&quot; like inviting a hundred people over just to &quot;Mac&quot; on one girl. Oh, and Lily-that's my leg.",Barney
269,You waited five minutes to tell me that?,Lily
270,Alright-so call her up!,Marshall
271,No-calling's not casual! I just gotta bump into her somewhere. If only I knew her schedule I could arrange a &quot;chance&quot; encounter.,Ted
272,"that's great, Ted. You'll be the most &quot;Casual&quot; stalker ever.",Lily
273,"Baby, no. I have a twenty-five paged paper on unconstitutional law due on Monday, I barely started,",Marshall
274,"Hey, I'm just sitting here. Wearing my ring... my beautiful ring. Kind of makes wearing other stuff seem wrong. Like my shirt. Kind of don't wanna wear my shirt anymore. Or... my underwear. Oh-that's right-I'm not wearing any.",Lily
275,(Closes laptop screen) No underwear?,Marshall
276,Not slightly.,Lily
277,"Guys, boundaries! There she is!",Ted

284,What are you doing here?,Robin
285,"Oh, you know, just-uh-Shopping for-uh-dip (holds dip) I love dip... I mean I don't love dip, I like dip. As a friend, you know. So-uh-hey, you-uh-reporting a news story or something? (puts dip back)",Ted
286,"Yeah, kid stuck in a crane machine, how sweet of you to call it news.",Robin
287,"Wow, kid in a crane machine (approached machine. To boy) You just had to have that toy didn't ya? Couldn't play the game like everyone else.",Ted
288,"Cute kid (wipes forehead) Um yeah it's f-it's so funny running into your we're having a party next Friday if-if you like swinging by! But, you know, whatever.",Ted

295,"So, Gatsby, what are you goanna do when Robin shows up?",Marshall
296,"Okay, I got it all planned out.",Ted
297,"She steps through the door, and where's Ted? Not eagerly waiting by the door. Nah I'm across the room at my drafting table showing some foxy young thing all my cool architecture stuff. So Robin strolls over and I casually give her one of these, &quot;Hey, what's up?&quot; She says, &quot;Hey, nice place&quot; etcetera, etcetera. And then I say, &quot;Well make yourself at home,&quot; and I casually return to my conversation. Then, an hour later, &quot;Oh, you're still here?&quot; I say like I don't really care, but it's a nice surprise. And then very casually, &quot;Wanna see the roof?&quot;",Ted
298,Get her up to the roof and the roof takes care of the rest.,Ted
299,What's so special about the roof?,Barney
300,"Oh, the moon, the stars, the shimmering skyline. You can't not fall in love on that roof.",Lily
301,We do it up there sometimes.,Marshall
302,"Solid plan, my little friend.",Barney
303,We're the same height.,Ted
304,But may I suggest one little modification.,Barney
305,"That foxy young thing you were chatting up, take her up to the roof and have sex with her! Crazy monkey-style.",Barney
306,That's not the plan.,Ted
307,"Should be the plan, I mean look at her. Ted, look at her. She's smokin'!",Barney
308,"Yeah, but she's not Robin.",Ted
309,"Exactly! Ted, let's wrap. Statistic, at every New York party there's always a girl who has no idea whose party she's at. She knows no one you know, and you will never see her again. Do you see-where I'm going-hu-with this?",Barney
310,"Barney, I don't wanna say-",Ted
311,"Aargh! (Pulls down imaginary scope) Scoping, beep, scoping, beep!",Barney
312,Man you're a dork.,Lily
313,"beep, beep, beep, beep. Target acquired! And now it's time we play a little game I like to call &quot;Have You Met Ted?&quot;",Barney
314,"No, come on not this.",Ted
315,(taps woman) Hi! Have you met Ted?,Barney
316,Hi.,Ted
317,Do you know Marshall? Lily?,Barney
318,"Hmm, do you know anyone at this party?",Barney
319,"Excuse me, (to group) Anyone know a Carlos?",Barney
320,No.,Ted
321,No.,Lily
322,On a silver platter! Bon appetite!,Barney
323,I don't think so.,Ted
324,"Your loss, her gain. (To Tatiana) Excuse me, can I show you the roof? It's magical up there!",Barney
325,Whoa-whoa-Hey hey. I got that roof reserved!,Ted
326,"Dude, Robin's not coming.",Barney
327,"Hey, she's goanna show up. (Silence) She'll show up.",Ted
328,At least it was a great party.,Lily
329,I ate like four whole cans of dip!,Marshall
330,You always know what to say old friend.,Ted
331,It's Robin.,Ted
332,Answer it!,Lily
333,"No, no, no. Not right away. I gotta seem casual. (Answers phone) Hello?",Ted
334,(on Phone) I'm so sorry I missed your party.,Robin
335,Who is this? Merideth?,Ted
336,(On Phone) Robin.,Robin
337,"Oh, Robin! Hey, yeah, guess you never showed up did you?",Ted
338,"(on Phone) no I got stuck at work, but they finally got that kid out of the crane machine.",Robin
339,Did he get to keep the purple giraffe?,Ted
340,"(on Phone) Yeah, they let him keep all the toys. He was in there a long time and little kids have smaller bladders.",Robin
341,(scoffs),Ted
342,(On Phone) I wish your party was tonight.,Robin
343,"It is the party's tonight. (Marshall's mad) Yeah-uh-it's a two day party. Because that's just how we roll. Uh-so if you wanna swing by its-uh-you know, Casual. See ya. (hangs up) So that was Robin.",Ted
344,"What are you doing to me, man. I got a paper to write.",Marshall
345,I know I'm sorry. It's terrible (grabs coat) I'll buy more dip (runs out),Ted
346,"TED! TED WAIT-GET FRENCH ONION. (Closes door) Can you believe this guy, I got a paper to write. (Lily smiles) Okay, fine-(they walk into the bedroom) but it's gotta be like super quick.",Marshall
347,Oh!,Lily
348,And no cuddling after.,Marshall
349,I'm the luckiest girl alive (runs into bedroom. Marshall strips.)</p><h,Lily
350,"Oh, you were so right about the roof. The roof. The roof is on fire, Ted! Girl from last night, took her back to my place then this morning took her outside, spun her around a couple of times sent her walking-she will never find her way back and there she is. How did she get here? Did you invite her?",Barney
351,I have no idea who that is.,Ted
352,"She said she works with Carlos, who's Carlos?",Barney
353,I don't know any Carlos.,Ted
354,"Grr. (Turns around) Hi, you. You're back.",Barney
355,&quot;sweetie&quot;? Really? (They walk into the kitchen Barney mouths) Sweetie?,Barney
356,"Whoa-Whoa rabbits! Come on, I got that roof reserved.",Ted
357,Alright.,Marshall
358,"So, it's over between me-and-works with Carlos girl.",Barney
359,"Oh, that was fast.",Ted
360,"Yeah, I was trying to think what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met?",Barney
361,I think I'm in love with you.,Barney
362,"Thanks, bro (walks away)",Barney
363,(straight-faced) Glad I could help.,Ted
364,"What the-no, no, no, no-come on!",Ted
365,"Sorry, Ted. (Goes up)",Marshall
366,Great! What am I going to do when Robin shows up. (Silence) She'll show up.,Ted
367,"Alright, we threw two parties. Everybody had fun. Everybody wanged, everybody chunged. Now the kid has got to get to work, and the kid is not to be disturbed. Repeat after me, &quot;I will not have sex with Marshall&quot;.",Marshall
368,It's Robin. (sighs. Answers) Hello?,Ted
369,"(on the Phone) Hi, Ted.",Robin
370,"Amanda? Oh, Denise-Sorry you totally sounded like Amanda (Does weird hand thing with Marshall)",Ted
371,(On Phone) It's Robin.,Robin
372,"Oh, Robin-(laughs)-Hi.",Ted
373,(On Phone) I totally wanted to come; I got stuck at work again. I feel like I live there. I'm sorry I missed your party...again.,Robin
374,"Hey, ain't no thing but a chicken wing mamacita. (To Lily and Marshall) WHO AM I?",Ted
375,(On Phone) I guess there's no change your two-dayer turned into a three-dayer.,Robin
376,"(Silence) It did indeed, the party continues tonight. (Marshall grabs for him, Ted runs away) Yeah. Last night people were like, &quot;KEEP IT GOIN' BRO! PARTY TRIFECTA!&quot;",Ted
377,"(On Phone) Wow, okay-well I'll be there.",Robin
378,"Great, see you tonight. (hangs up. Looks to Marshall) So that was Robin.</p><h",Ted
379,"Oh, this is lame.",Barney
380,lame or &quot;Casual&quot;?,Ted
381,lame.,Barney
382,Or &quot;Casual&quot;?,Ted
383,Hey little old books. Ready for a little fifteen minute recess?,Lily
384,"Sorry, baby, I gotta work. I need all my bl*od (points to brain) up here. Has anybody seen an introduction to contract work institution statutes from 1865 to 1923? (Silence) Anybody seen a big-ass book?",Marshall
385,Of course.,Barney
386,Who? Who invited you? No one even know who you are!,Barney
387,Who is Carlos!?,Barney
388,"Okay, where the hell is my-OHH! (Book has been used as coaster, all wet) Okay, introduction to contract work institution statutes from 1865 to 1923...is not a coaster! Ted! I'm jeopardizing my law career so that you can throw not one, not two, but three parties for some girl that you just met who's probably not gonna show up. (Ted's shocked) I mean where is she, Ted, huh? Where's Robin? (Finds Robin) Hi! Hi Robin. (Throws book on the floor and grabs Lily for sex)",Marshall
389,so you threw all these parties for me?,Robin
390,"No! Oh you thought that-oh, no! I c-okay yes. You got me-I-(laughs)-one of the reasons I threw these parties was so that I could introduce you to uh-(Barney throws Ted a random guy) this guy. I figured, you know, since it didn't work out between us and now we can just laugh about it (nervously laughs)-Anyway Robin, this is.",Ted
391,"She's still talking to Carlos. I can still win this, it's not over.",Ted
392,"Okay, buddy, time for the &quot;tough-talk&quot;. Robin seems great. But let's look at the facts, you wanna get married and right now there's a million women in New York looking for exactly you, but Robin ain't one of them.",Lily
393,She's not just &quot;one of them&quot; she's the one.,Ted
394,"Yeah well, &quot;the one&quot; is heading up to &quot;the roof&quot;. (Robin leaves to the roof with Carlos)",Barney
395,What are you gonna do?,Marshall
396,"Nothing. It's a game, I gotta just-keep playing it.",Ted
397,Hey.,Robin
398,"Hey. Carlos, can you give us a minute?",Ted
399,"Robin, look I didn't invite you to this party to set you up with Carlos. Or the one before that. Or the one before that. (Robin smiles) I threw these parties because I wanted to see you.",Ted
400,"Well, here I am.",Robin
401,"There's something here, look, unless I'm crazy.",Ted
402,"(exhales) you're not crazy. I-I don't know, Ted, I mean we barely know each other and you're looking at me with that look and it's like-(struggles)",Robin
403,Like what?,Ted
404,"like-let's fall in love, and get married and have kids and drive them to soccer practice.",Robin
405,I'm not gonna force sports on them unless they're interested.,Ted
406,(laughs) It's a great look. But you're looking at the wrong girl.,Robin
407,"No, I'm not.",Ted
408,"Yes, you are. I don't wanna get married right now, maybe ever and if we got together I'd feel like I'd either have to marry you or break your heart and-I just couldn't do either of those things. Just like you can't turn off the way you feel.",Robin
409,(reaches in his Jacket) Click. Off. Let's make out.,Ted
410,(laughs) What?,Robin
411,"What? That was the off switch! And I turned it off. I mean sure yes, I wanna fall in love get married blah, blah, blah, but-on the other hand... you... me...the roof.",Ted
412,There's no off switch.,Robin
413,There is an off switch... and it's off.,Ted
414,"(smiling) no, it's not.",Robin
415,"(silence) yes, it is. (They draw closer)",Ted
416,No (smiles)...it's-not.,Robin
417,"Yes-it is (they kiss long) No it's not. You're right, there's no off switch. God I wish there was an off switch.",Ted
418,(sighs) me too.,Robin
419,So (They mutter together. Then laugh),Ted
420,we could be friends (shrugs),Robin
421,Oh (clutches heart),Ted
422,"look, I know it sounds insincere when people say that but... we could.",Robin
423,"I don't know, Robin. I made such a jackass out of myself here, every time we start hanging out it'll be like, &quot;Oh-that's right-I'm a jackass.&quot;",Ted
424,You're not a jackass. I'm sorry. I only moved here in April and I'm always working and-I just haven't met a lot of good people so far. But I understand.,Robin
425,"Well-uh-maybe in a few months after it's not so fresh, we could all-uh...you know, get a beer.",Ted
426,"yeah. (sighs) That sounds good. I'll see you, Ted. (walks away)",Robin
427,"Or, you know-now. (Robin looks at Ted) We could all get a beer now.",Ted
428,(Smiles) I'd like that.,Robin
429,"My friends are goanna love you-like you-you know, as a friend. (Robin giggles) Jackass.",Ted
430,"Unbelievable. That is just a recipe for disaster, they work together (Carlos and Tatiana are making out)",Barney
431,You jealous?,Ted
432,"Oh, please, what does Carlos have that I don't?",Barney
433,a date tonight?,Robin
434,"Stop the tape, rewind-play it again.",Lily
435,(Imitates a rewinding tape) a date tonight? (smiles),Robin
436,I'm not sure I like her.,Barney
437,"Hey, don't you have a paper to write?",Ted
438,"Dude, you're talking to the kid.",Marshall
439,I know it.,Ted
440,"I'm goanna knock back this beer. I'm gonna knock back one more beer. I'm gonna go home, I'm gonna write a twenty-five page paper. I'm gonna hand it in and I'm gonna get a A. My name is Rufus, and that's the Trufus.",Marshall
441,At least let me buy you a beer. Come on I'll buy everyone a beer.,Ted
442,"I'll help carry. You know something, Ted?",Robin
443,What?,Ted
444,"You are a catch. You're gonna make some girl very happy, and I am going to help you find her.",Robin
445,"(laughs) Well, good luck. I mean maybe New York's just too big a town, you know? There's millions of people in this city. How in all this mess is a guy supposed to find the love of his life? I mean, where do you even begin?",Ted
446,"Hi, Have you met Ted?",Robin
447,"(mouths) Hi, I'm Ted (Robin takes the beer to the table. Ted watches her while the Cute Girl talks to him. Robin looks back. Smiles.

454,"Yeah, cause MacLaren's is fun...",Ted
455,MacLaren's is this much fun. What I'm offering is the chance to have this much fun.,Barney
456,"See, you say that. You say it's going to be this much fun. But most of the time it ends up being this much fun. This much fun is good! It's safe. It's guaranteed!",Ted
457,"This hand gesture thing doesn't really work on the phone, does it?",Barney
458,No it doesn't.,Ted

463,Uhh... because he's getting laid.,Barney
464,Consistently.,Marshall

529,(On Phone) I...I didn't ask.,Marshall
530,(On Phone) Well it sounds like you're having a lot more fun than I am. I'm just talking to guys' backs while they hit on Robin.,Lily
531,"(On Phone) Ouff, yeah... I bet she gets that a lot.",Marshall
532,(On Phone) Don't you bet I get that a lot?,Lily
533,"(On Phone) Not with a ring on your finger. I mean, you know, guys see the ring and it's like Cha-Chung! Marshall parking only.",Marshall
534,"(On Phone) Oh, of course, that's it the ring! I guess I'm not used to it yet.",Lily
535,"(On Phone) Oh, it's totally the ring. If you took that ring off your finger, you'd have a ton o' guys crowding around your junk.",Marshall
536,(On Phone) I'm not going to take off my ring! Wouldn't you be jealous of guys swarming all over my beeswax?,Lily
537,(On Phone) Bye.,Lily
538,"Robin! Robin. (Waves her left hand ridiculously to show that she has no ring. Robin walks over) Hey, I'm over here.",Lily

543,(On Phone) Fine! (Hangs up),Marshall
544,"(To Ted) No! No! The night is just started. Look, airport bar. Flight attendants! They'll get your tray table at its full upright position. Say what? (Goes for a high five)",Barney
545,"Barney, I am going to k*ll you.",Ted
546,"Don't say you're going to k*ll someone in front of airport security, not cool. (To security) Not cool.",Barney
547,This is an outrage. We are international businessmen on an international business trip. I demand you release us immediately.,Barney
548,"You demand!? No, no, no, no, no... he does not demand. We... we... we have no demands!",Ted
549,"(Whispering) Okay, yeah. I'm calm... I'm totally calm.",Ted
550,(To Ted) Those bags were your responsibility.,Barney
551,They were your bags.,Ted
552,"Look, this is all just... it's a misunderstanding.",Ted
553,(Stopping him) Please. (Silence) We are international businessmen. My colleague accidentally left the bags there now please let us go before we miss our international business meeting.,Barney
554,"Believe it or not, that duff bag thing worked.",Barney
555,"Truth is, my friend... he does this thing where he goes to airports with fake luggage to pick up girls and we followed some here to Philadelphia. That's it! That's all this is!",Ted
556,"Yes, he's that lame. Tell them you're that lame!",Ted
557,We are international businessmen...,Barney
558,OH COME ON!,Ted
559,"Dude, seriously, relax.",Barney
560,We at least get to call our lawyer.,Ted
561,Exactly! (To Ted) We have a lawyer?,Barney
562,"(On Phone) Listen to me, you're both American citizens. Don't let them pull any patriot-act voodoo. You both retain the right to refuse to answer any questions without an attorney present so don't say anything until I get there, alright? Okay, goodbye (Hangs up. Sings) To Philly! The adventure continues! Destroy!",Marshall
563,"It's ridiculous in here, why don't we go somewhere else?",Robin
564,"(Unbuttoning sweater) No, this place is great (positions mouth in an inviting kiss position)",Lily
565,What are you doing?,Robin
566,What?,Lily
567,With your lips and everything...?,Robin
568,My lips are always like this (drinks martini and drops it all over her blouse),Lily
569,You had to play the race card.,Ted
570,"Relax, Ted. We didn't do anything wrong. And, B.T.W, we'd be out of here by now if you'd have tucked in your shirt. (Ted turns his head to face away from Barney)",Barney
571,(On Phone) Don't come to Philly.,Ted
572,"(On Phone) Man, I'm almost half way there!",Marshall

588,"Ooh, look a booth opened up.",Robin
589,Really.,Lily
590,"Yeah, I thought we could finally go talk, and you're not listening to me, so I'm going to walk away. (notices Lily is busy staring at a stranger)",Robin
591,"Yeah, yeah...booth (throws purse to Robin, spots a man. Robin leaves to booth. Man walks up to Robin.)",Lily
592,"(Smiling) Hey. (Silence) I'm engaged, sorry. (Puts ring on) I took my ring off! It's very, very sweet of you to come over and talk to me, but I... just...",Lily
593,"Oh, damn it! (Takes ring off and places it in her pocket, upset)",Lily

599,(On Phone) She's uh...,Robin
600,"(On Phone) Is she talking to some hot guy? Oh, you can tell me. It's totally cool. It was my idea! Hell, I told her she could take the ring off.",Marshall
601,"(On Phone) Really? Well I thought it was kinda weird, but if you're cool with it. Yeah. It's off and she's talking to some guy. Do you want me to go over and...",Robin
602,"(On Phone) No! Don't interrupt it's awesome. So the rings really off, huh? (Realizing what he's done) It's awesome... Well just tell her I called and... tell her that... she's awesome. (Hangs up. Sings dryly) Really, really awesome. Our relationship is built on mutual trust. (Dryly) I can't breathe!",Marshall
603,"(Laughs) Did you hear that, Ted? Dana works security at the Liberty Bell.",Barney
604,Wow it must be really well cornered off over there. You ever go behind the rope and touch it?,Barney
605,"Ever, like, stick your head inside it?",Barney
606,D'you ever lick it?,Barney
607,Hmm... I bet nobody in history has ever licked the Liberty Bell! If someone were to pull that off I dare say it would be... what's the word?,Barney
608,"(Decides he's going to leave) Well, this is my stop.",Ted
609,"Legendary, Ted, LEGENDARY!",Barney
610,"Barney, I'm going to the airport. Sascha, thank you... and uh... tell your grandpa I'm sorry I walked in on him in the bathroom. (Leaves)",Ted
611,"(enters) Lily, I thought tonight was about us hanging out, what are you doing?",Robin
612,Just fending up the advances of that totally hot guy.,Lily
613,"Dude, I think that guy is gay.",Robin
614,"(Gives in) Oh, I know that guy is gay. Just Marshall and I have been together for nine years. I haven't been single since high school.",Lily
615,"You wanna be single? (Laughs) You wanna fight off loser guys all night, does that seem like fun to you?",Robin
616,"I guess I wanted to throw this net back into the ocean and see how many fish I could catch. So far, one. One gay dolphin. (Smiles)",Lily
617,"And Marshall. Lily, all these girls here tonight are looking to catch what you've already got.",Robin
618,You're right I know. Hey do you wanna get some coffee and have an actual conversation?,Lily
619,"If, by &quot;Coffee&quot; you mean &quot;Cheesecake&quot;, then yes.",Robin
620,"Oh, thank you so much.",Lily
621,"Marshall, no.",Lily
622,"Baby, please don't ever take that ring off again. No matter how awesome I say that it is.",Marshall
623,BACK OFF HOMBRE. I'm not that afraid to fight you. You wanna test this guy? Be my guest!,Marshall
624,"Marshall, he's gay!",Lily
625,"Oh, thank god... I've never been in a fight before. (hugs him)",Marshall
626,Hey!,Lily
627,Could have licked the Liberty Bell.,Barney
628,We're going to the airport.,Ted
629,"Bong, bong...",Barney
630,"Why do I hang out with you? Why? All I wanted was to have a regular beer, in a regular bar with my regular friends, in my regular city!",Ted
631,"Ted, Ted... you're not even looking.",Barney
632,"No, I'm not.",Ted
633,"Look, our forefathers died for the pursuit of happiness, okay. Not for the sit around and wait of happiness. Now if you want, you can go to the same bar, drink the same beer talk to the same people everyday, or you can lick the Liberty Bell! You can grab life by the crack and lick the crap out of it!",Barney
634,"Thanks, Leonard. Ted, you're missing out on a valuable life lesson!",Barney
635,"Look, I don't need you to teach me how to live, okay. I know how to live. If you want to go lick the Liberty Bell just go lick it yourself.",Ted
636,"No, it has to be the two of us.",Barney
637,Why? Why do you need me?,Ted
638,"Because, you're my best friend, alright? You don't have to tell me I'm yours. But the way I see it, we're a team. Without you, I'm just the dynamic uno. You know what, fine. If you wanna go home... then we'll go home.",Barney
639,Fine...we'll go lick the Liberty Bell!,Ted
640,"Good, (smiles) 'cuz we're here! (Hops out)",Barney
641,"(voice) I had no idea how Barney redirected the cab without me knowing, but we got out, Dana let us in and by god we licked the Liberty Bell. And you know what it tastes like?",Ted
642,Freedom... No actually it tasted like pennies.,Ted
643,(mouths) Wow.,Ted
644,Nice shirt!,Robin
645,Right? Right?,Ted
646,Look at those colors! Green and brown together at last!,Lily
647,"Hot top, Bro, is it new?",Marshall
648,"That's the crazy part. I've had this shirt for, like, six years... Until this morning I wasn't into it at all, but now it's like my tastes have changed.",Ted
649,Booger.,Barney
650,"Yes, hello, Barney.",Ted
651,Barney's offering me fifty bucks to say some stupid word on a live news report.,Robin
652,"Not some stupid word, &quot;Booger&quot;.",Barney
653,"But I'm not doing it, I am a journalist.",Robin
654,"What? Journalist? You do the little fluff pieces at the end of the news. Old people, babies, monkeys... that's not journalism, that's just things in a diaper.",Barney
655,"For your information, my boss is about to bump me up to the City Hall b*at.",Robin
656,"City hall, Miss Thang!",Lily
657,So I'm not going to jeopardize my promotion by saying &quot;Booger&quot; for fifty bucks.,Robin
658,"Of course not, because now you're saying &quot;Nipple&quot; and it's a hundred! (Whispers) Step into my web.",Barney
659,(Sipping drink) Mmm... Who's bourbon is this?,Ted
660,"Ooh, I don't know. It was here when we sat down.",Lily
661,"Aaah, point is. I seem to like bourbon now. I could have sworn I hated bourbon. First the shirt, now bourbon. I spent twenty-seven years making up my mind about things, right? The movie I saw once in Haden, the city I'll never go back to because it was raining the day I visited. Maybe it's time to start forming some second impressions...",Ted
662,"You're finally gonna watch &quot;Goonies AGAIN? Slow love, Chuck&quot;.",Marshall
663,"(Laughs) Not Goonies, girls. What if there's someone from my past, who I thought was wrong for me at the time, but in fact she, like my shirt, is actually a perfect fit?",Ted
664,"Hold up, there are only two reasons to date a girl you've already dated. Breast, Implants.",Barney
665,"That's not a bad idea. Let's think, Ted's greatest hits... what about that girl, Steph?",Lily
666,Steph...,Ted
667,"Wow, okay... how many did you make?",Ted
668,Say what you will about the p*rn industry... they are hard workers.,Lily
669,What about that chick...um...Jackie?,Marshall
670,And my bathing suit had fallen completely off.,Ted
671,Uh...no.,Ted
672,What about Natalie!,Lily
673,Who's Natalie?,Robin
674,"Man, I haven't seen her in like three years!",Ted
675,Well why'd you guys break up?,Robin
676,"I just wasn't looking for a big commitment at the time, of course now a big commitment doesn't seem so bad... maybe I should call her? What do you guys think?",Ted
677,You dumped a p*rn star? Friendship over (gets up) FRIENDSHIP OVER!,Barney
678,"You wanted to see me, Mr. Adams?",Robin
679,"City Hall? (Pans In) Oh, my god.",Robin
680,"So, next time you're passing City Hall, make sure and stop by New York's oldest hotdog cart. Today a delicious hotdog will cost you $2.50, but back when the stand first opened in 1955, you could get one for only a nipple. Reporting live, Robin Scherbatsky, Metro News One.",Robin
681,"I said, &quot;Nipple&quot; on the news! That was so unprofessional! I said, &quot;Nipple&quot; on the news!",Robin
682,At least it's better than booger. (Laughs) Booger.,Lily
683,"There she is. Hey is it cold in here, because I can kind of see Robin's nickels? Now for your next challenge...",Barney
684,"No, there is not going to be another challenge, I don't care how much you offer me.",Robin
685,"Oh, search your soul, Robin. You and I both know this wasn't about the money. Sure, Metro News One pays you jack and hey, a little green salad on the side's good for you, me and Mr. McGee.",Barney
686,"Seriously, who talks like that?",Lily
687,"Well baby really likes, is the thrill of pulling one over on those bean counters, who under appreciate you and still haven't promoted you. And for two more hundy-sticks, baby's going to look in the camera and say this (Whispers in her ear)",Barney
688,Eew. I'm just assuming.,Lily
689,(sighs) I gotta get back to work. See ya.,Robin
690,Bye.,Lily
691,(To Barney) Baby's going to think about it.,Robin
692,Found it! I found Natalie's number.,Ted
693,"Hey, Ted. Nice shirt! Is it yesterday already?",Lily
694,"Thank you. I am calling her; this is crazy I haven't talked to her in, like, three years. I wonder if she even remembers me.",Ted
695,"Natalie, its Ted Mosby.",Ted
696,She remembers me.,Ted
697,Why would Natalie hang up on you?,Lily
698,I don't know!,Ted
699,Did you sleep with her sister?,Barney
700,No.,Ted
701,Sleep with her mom?,Barney
702,No.,Ted
703,I'm losing interest in your story.,Barney
704,"Well, you must have done something. Why did you guys break up?",Lily
705,He wasn't ready for a commitment.,Marshall
706,Uh-huh.,Lily
707,And her birthday might have been coming up.,Ted
708,(angrier) Uh-huh...,Lily
709,"Okay, so I didn't wanna get a boyfriend level gift for a girl I was just about to break up with.",Ted
710,So you dumped her right before her birthday?,Lily
711,"No, I didn't dump her... right before her birthday.",Ted
712,Uh-oh.,Marshall

717,I don't know.,Ted
718,"How do you n...Oh, you didn't!",Lily
719,"Natalie! Hey, Happy Birthday! (Scene splits in two to show he's leaving a message on her machine) Listen... you're awesome. You really are... awesome. I'm just like super busy right now, so... maybe we should just... call it a day. But you're awesome.",Ted
720,(Hitting with every word) On...her...answering...machine!? And...on...her... birthday? Oh... who... breaks... up... with... somebody... on... their... answering... machine... on... their... birthday?!,Lily
721,"Yeah, dude, email!",Marshall
722,"Not exactly the point I was trying to make, Marshall. That is a terrible way to break up with someone.",Lily
723,"Okay, in my client's defense. Is there an unterrible way to break up with somebody? No. Personally I'd rather hear the bad news on an answering machine than face the humiliation in person. (Lily Picks up her phone) It's the least painful way you can do it. Who are you calling?",Marshall
724,"(On Phone) Hi, Marshall, it's Lily. We're not going have sex for at least a month. But you're awesome. Okay bye-bye. (Hangs up)",Lily
725,"Know, that was a big mistake, Ted. You should've done it in person.",Barney
726,Thank you.,Lily
727,Desperate &quot;Please-don't-leave-me&quot; sex is amazing.,Barney
728,"Okay, it was childish and stupid, I just...I didn't want to see her cry.",Ted
729,Well guess what? She cried! You just didn't have the sack to face those tears.,Lily
730,"That was me then, okay? This is the new old shirt-wearing, sack-having Ted. I'm gonna make this right.",Ted
731,You know what else? My younger sister just got married and I'm about to turn thirty-sex. Fantastic.,Barney

743,"No, look... I was an idiot for leaving that message. I realize how much that sucked.",Ted
744,"(On Machine) Maybe we should just, call it a day? But you're awesome. Okay, bye. (Hangs up)",Ted
745,"There was a surprise party that night? (Natalie nods) How come nobody told me? People think I can't keep a secret but I totally can! Sorry, not the issue... Look, Natalie, I was just a stupid kid back then, terrified of commitment.",Ted
746,"Well, yeah, actually (smiling). I'm a different guy now. Give me another chance.",Ted
747,Come on... Just a cup of coffee. (Pretending the sock monkey's talking) Please Natalie. Give the guy a chance. (Natalie looks at the sock monkey) Self respect is over-rated! (Monkey raises right arm as though it's a fact. Natalie laughs),Ted

761,Ineffable... good word. So when are you going to do it?,Marshall
762,"She's probably on the subway by now. You could call her Voice Mail. Beep, dumped. Click. Done!",Barney

767,"Well, I think Natalie deserves better.",Lily
768,Better. There's no better in breaking up. There's only less awful. A clichÃ©'s a clichÃ© for a reason. It's comforting.,Marshall
769,"It doesn't matter, I already told her I am ready for a commitment, so... oh, my god... there's no way out... I'm going to have to marry her.",Ted
770,"No, no. We're going to get you out of this. Okay, how about... &quot;It's not you it's me&quot;?",Marshall

777,"Oh, you can't tell her that. That's horrible.",Marshall
778,Why? What is so horrible about that?,Lily
779,"Yeah, what is so horrible about that?...&quot;She's not the one.&quot; Why is that such a heart-breaking thing to hear? The chances of one person being another person's &quot;The one&quot; are like six billion to one.",Ted

798,(On TV) In your past sixteen years on the job what is your most exciting memory?,Robin
799,Ahh! This is it.,Barney
800,"Oh, boy, here we go.",Lily
801,"(To everyone in the bar) Everyone, everyone... If I may direct your attention to the television. You're about to see something... amazing.",Barney
802,"Come on, baby... bring it home.",Barney
803,(on TV) What?,Robin
804,"It's an honor to tell your story, Henry.",Robin
805,"(on TV) You know, Metro News One may not be number one in viewer ship. But this reporter takes pride in... (trips and falls off camera) Whoa!! OH! Oh, my god! I'm covered in horse crap! It's in my hair!! Oh my, ow... ow my knee.",Robin
806,You planned that?,Marshall
807,"No, Marshall. That was beyond my wildest dreams (Robin's wailing on TV)",Barney
808,"Look, Natalie, there's something I have to say and there's no good way to say it. I wanna break up. I don't think you're the one for me. I don't want to waste your time because I really like you. I wanna do right by you, and I think the best way to do that is just to be honest. I'm sorry. (Natalie covers her face) Just let it out. They're only tears. (Throws her spaghetti on him) Aah!",Ted
809,I'm sorry. I just thought the mature thing to do would be...,Ted
810,"Yes, I know I didn't realize that it was...",Ted
811,It's really not such a big deal. I mean it's the odds. It's like you lost the lottery.,Ted
812,"No, no, no. I didn't mean that.",Ted
813,It's... I can't explain it.,Ted
814,It's... ineffable.,Ted
815,"No, no, no, no. Ineffable, ineffable means it can't be explained.",Ted
816,"Oh, god what's going on?",Ted
817,"No, it's... it's not like that. I'm just... it's, it's, it's.",Ted
818,I'm just like super busy right now.,Ted
819,But isn't it nice to know that people are watching?,Barney
820,"Oh, my god. Are you alright?",Marshall
821,What happened to you?,Lily
822,"Told the truth, turns out the truth has a mean round house kick.",Ted
823,"Oh, man.",Marshall
824,"Oh, well you did the right thing. I'm proud of you.",Lily
825,I'm bleeding internally.,Ted
826,"Hey, Ted, you know what always picks me up when I'm down? Other people's misfortune. You missed something so amazing.",Barney
827,Please can we please have one person in this whole bar who didn't see it?,Robin
828,Fine.,Barney
829,Are you okay?,Lily
830,"I really thought I was going the good way this time. I guess there is no good way. Sometimes no matter how hard you try to do the right thing, you just end up flat on your back flailing around in a big pile of horse crap!",Ted
831,You saw it?,Robin
832,"It's going against the internet now! It's okay, grow up.",Ted
833,Say you're my bitch.,Robin
834,I'm your bitch. Why this time?,Ted
835,"Because tonight, I am getting us all into &quot;Okay&quot;.",Robin
836,&quot;Okay&quot;!? Awesome!!,Barney
837,"What's going on, did I just have a stroke?",Ted
838,"&quot;Okay&quot; is the name of a club. Yeah, it's supposed to be incredibly exclusive. This friend of mine once waited outside for two hours, he couldn't get in.",Barney
839,A friend of yours named you?,Ted
840,"No... a friend of mine named, shut up.",Barney
841,"Yeah, well the owner goes to my gym. It turns out that he is a fan of my reporting for Metro News One. So now, I'm on the list for tonight.",Robin
842,"Nice going, Scherbatsky. You're becoming a long and difficult-to-spell household name.",Ted
843,He's even getting me into the VIP room.,Robin
844,"Yeah, he just wants to show you his own VIP if you know what I mean...",Barney
845,"Okay, what does &quot;VIP&quot; stand for in your universe?",Robin
846,... I know that the &quot;P&quot; is penis.,Barney
847,"Alright, so you guys are in. Should I invite Marshall and Lily?",Robin
848,TEN SECONDS!!,Marshall
849,SUCK IT LOSERS! (Burps),Lily
850,"You know, quiet time with the fiancÃ©.",Lily
851,"I don't know, I just felt embarrassed. Claire is my age, and she and her husband do all these classy grownup stuff. Maybe we should start doing some grownup stuff.",Lily
852,That was some pretty grownup stuff we did this morning.,Marshall
853,"(Laughs) Yeah, but it wasn't classy. Maybe we should have a wine tasting party.",Lily
854,"I like wine. I like tasting. You know I can party, let's do it. Let's rock it, maturity style!",Marshall
855,"Ever since then she's been signing him up for book clubs, cooking classes...",Ted
856,All the things you do when you know where the next ten thousand lays are coming from.,Barney
857,"So, no. Lily and Marshall will not be doing this.",Ted
858,"Got it. Anyway, Ted, part two of my story: my friend Kelly's going to be there.",Robin
859,"Kelly, who supposedly I'm gonna love?",Ted
860,"Oh, you are gonna love Kelly. She's fun, she's smart, she lives in the moment.",Robin
861,"Translation, she's ugly, she's ugly, she ugs in the ugly.",Barney
862,"Oh, and she's totally hot.",Robin
863,"Okay, I guess I can take her off your hands for an evening.",Ted
864,"So, do you have any other hot single fr...",Barney
865,"No, Kelly works with the news breakers...",Robin
866,"Oh, no, Ted, your blazer!",Lily
867,"What, what, what...?",Ted
868,Somebody spilled gorgeous all over it. Love it!,Lily
869,Thank you.,Ted
870,(enters) And his hair was perfect.,Barney
871,"Hey we're wearing the same shirt! Oh, wait no that's just my shirt reflected in yours.",Lily
872,"One of the twenty-four similarities between girls and fish is that they're both attracted to shiny objects. You really never read my blog, do you?",Barney
873,"Alright, Tin-Man. Let's hit it.",Ted
874,"Alright, well, have fun at your little disco, guys.",Marshall
875,What the hell happened to these two?,Barney
876,Marshall and I are just growing up.,Lily
877,"Yeah, it's going to be sweet, too. Like tonight we're tasting all these different wines, pairing them up with these cool gourmet cheeses...",Marshall
878,"Wow, who knew being committed in a heterosexual relationship could make a guy so gay.",Barney
879,"Alright, cool kids are leaving now. Grandma, grandpa... don't wait up.",Ted
880,"My, oh, my there are some ferocious looking cutlets here tonight. Alright, hookup strategy, colon, find a cutlet; lock her in early, grind with her all night till she's mine.",Barney
881,Do strategies ever work for you?,Ted
882,Question is: do these strategies ever not work for me? Either way the answer's &quot;about half the time&quot;.,Barney
883,(Shows up) My bitches! Check this out. (To Doorman) They're with me. (Doorman allows them in),Robin
884,"Ah, no I think we're going to wait on the baby thing. I mean I love babies. Babies rule. Pudgy arms and stuff, but they make you old. Kind of like this anchor weighing you down to one spot...forever.",Marshall
885,I don't know guys. It's not awkward unless we let it be awkward.,Marshall
886,This place seems great. Is Kelly here?,Ted
887,"Yeah, she's around somewhere. Let's go find her, I'll introduce you guys. Then I should probably dock into the VIP room, so stupid and arbitrary isn't it, who get's to be in VIP and who doesn't?",Robin
888,Can we come?,Ted
889,It's... not that arbitrary...,Robin
890,Whoa... this place in lourd!,Ted
891,You think?,Barney
892,"(Subtitle) Okay, it's a little loud.",Barney
893,(Subtitle) There's Kelly. (Leads them through the crowd),Robin
894,(Subtitle) You want to go somewhere we can talk?,Ted
895,(Subtitle)...Okay...,Ted
896,You think it was kind of weird that Ted didn't invite me out with him?,Marshall
897,"Why, you'd rather be out at some dance club, all noisy and sweaty with the... (Imitates music b*at). Is that what you want? (Imitates music b*at.)",Lily
898,Is this what you want? (Imitating Chris) Thirty year fixed mortgage. (Imitating Claire) I'm three months pregnant. (You see Claire behind him) That was awkward. (Claire turns around and leaves),Marshall
899,(to guests) Let's start drinking!,Lily
900,Freaking ten ends.,Marshall
901,(To VIP room doorman. Subtitle) Robin Scherbastky? (Door man shakes head) Robin Scherbatsky! (Doorman refuses. Robin walks away),Robin
902,"(Subtitle) So, how do you know Robin?",Ted
903,(Subtitle) Is that near Westchester?,Ted
904,You know what they're doing in there right now? They're watching Claire's ultrasound video and I swear to god even the baby looks bored.,Marshall
905,"Come on, it's not that bad. We're really starting to click with these guys. Claire and Austin just invited us to their fondue fest next Saturday night.",Lily
906,You're also trying to get me excited about fondue?,Marshall
907,"It's dipping stuff in hot cheese, what's not to love?",Lily
908,"Okay, that does sound good. But it's dipping stuff in hot cheese with boring people.",Marshall
909,"Marshall, it's time for us to grow up.",Lily
910,Taxi!,Marshall
911,(Subtitle) &quot;14&quot;?,Ted
912,(Subtitle) &quot;7&quot;?,Ted
913,Please tell me we can drink the wine now.,Lily
914,Freaking tannins.,Lily
915,"(Subtitle) You really like this place? (Kelly nods. Subtitle) You have no idea what I'm saying, do you? I'm from outer space! I got thrown out of Sea World for humping a dolphin! (Music stops. Ted yells) I'M WETTING MY PANTS. (Everyone stares at him. Music begins again)",Ted
916,"Hey, Robin.",Marshall
917,Hey!,Robin
918,Why aren't you inside?,Marshall
919,"I'm calling the owner, there's a guy in there who won't let me in to the stupid VIP room. What are you doing here?",Robin
920,"Oh, I had this move. So I came here to bust it. Can you get me in? (Motions to doorman that he's with her)",Marshall
921,"Great, voicemail.",Robin
922,"Thanks, I'll see ya.",Marshall
923,Bye.,Robin
924,"(On Phone) And it's not that I care so much about getting into the VIP room, I have been in tons of VIP rooms, not exactly a VIP room virgin. (You see doormen changing shifts) Seriously, call me back. (Turns around to doorman #2) Oh, um... I was just in there. Robin Scherbatsky, I'm on the list.",Robin
925,"But, I'm Robin Scherbatsky. I'm a reporter for channel one.",Robin
926,"(Subtitle) I'm bailing, see ya.",Ted
927,"(Subtitle) Oh hey, I can't see her face. Is she hot?",Barney
928,(Subtitle) Nice eyes. Cute smile. Out of your league.,Ted
929,"Aah! Coat wench do not uncheck that man's jacket. Sorry, just being dramatic. You're not a wench.",Marshall
930,What are you doing here? Lily let you go?,Ted
931,Lily? Pfft. Who cares right?,Marshall
932,You are so dead.,Ted
933,"Oh, I'm so dead.",Marshall
934,Wow. Uh... I'm going home.,Ted
935,"Aah! I put my ass and probably other parts of my body on the line to party with my bro. Now damn it, we're gonna party.",Marshall
936,"Alright, one beer.",Ted
937,"Yes, finally I don't have to wait half an hour for a drink.",Marshall
938,(Subtitle) Yeah. No tannins.,Marshall
939,(Subtitle) AAAGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!! (Pulls out crown),Marshall
940,"(Subtitle) Come on, let's go. (Marshall refuses)",Ted
941,"(Subtitle) I'm staying. (Marshall dances ridiculously, in pain)",Marshall
942,"Marshall, are you okay?",Lily
943,Taxi!,Lily
944,Hey.,Lily
945,Hey.,Robin
946,Marshall just ditched out on our own party. Can you get me in there? I kind of need to k*ll him.,Lily
947,"Actually, I can't even get myself in. I was such a dork. I get recognized one time and I start thinking I'm Julia Roberts. No VIP. I'm not even an IP. I'm just a lonely little P sitting out here in the gutter.",Robin
948,Know something; I'd take a pee in the gutter over Julia Roberts any day. (They realize it sounds gross and laugh),Lily
949,(Subtitle) There's Barney. I'm leaving. (Marshall wobbles over to Barney),Ted
950,Broke my tooth.,Marshall
951,...Do you have...,Marshall
952,...any aspirin?,Marshall
953,Maybe theres...,Barney
954,a machine in...,Barney
955,The restroom.,Barney
956,"Yeah, these clubs are supposed to be fun, right? Why do I hate them so much?",Ted
957,Or New Year's Eve.,Ted
958,Or parades.,Ted
959,Or parades.,Ted
960,I really hate parades. (Laughs),Ted
961,"He just left, in the middle of our own party, you don't do that. Unless, of course, you're chasing after someone who's already done it, and then I think it's okay.",Lily
962,"Well, I hate to take his side... but come one a wine tasting? What's the big plan for next Saturday, scrabble night?",Robin
963,Don't check your email.,Lily
964,Why are you becoming this person? I heard that in college you flashed a campus tour group on a dare.,Robin
965,"Once on a dare. The other times were just for fun. I'm not in college anymore. I'd love to go back and be that person again, but you can't move backwards you can only go forward.",Lily
966,"Um, pause... you can go wherever you want. I guess the question is where do you want to go?",Robin
967,I want to go into this club and find my fiancÃ©.,Lily
968,Well that you can't do. (Silence),Robin
969,"Wanna bet? (They get up) Follow my lead. (To doorman) Hey, big guy. (Flashes doorman, geeks watching.) I said follow my lead.",Lily
970,Right.,Ted
971,"So, by that logic, if you and I were to, say, go out on a date.",Ted
972,Right. The DMV it is.,Ted
973,"Sounds awful, it's a date.",Ted
974,But there's still one big question that needs to be answered.,Ted
975,How many of these coats do you think I could put on all at once?,Ted
976,(Comes out wearing many coats) Barney.,Ted
977,"Ted, bring your coat, we're leaving.",Barney
978,"What? What happened to that, uh, cutlet you were grinding with?",Ted
979,"That was my cousin, Leslie.",Barney
980,(laughs) What?!,Ted
981,"No, no, no... we are not laughing about this, Ted. This is not going to be some funny story that we'll be telling in a couple months. It's not gonna be like, &quot;Hey, remember that time when you were grinding with... NO! And you know why? Because, italics, this night did not happen. And you promise me that you will never, ever, ever tell another soul what transpired here tonight. You promise. Promise",Barney
982,"(Laughing) Alright, I promise. Let's get Marshall and go, okay. (Takes coats off. To Coat Check Girl) Hey. Thanks for saving my night. I'll talk to you soon? Umm, hey... tip her, Barney.",Ted
983,"Why, I didn't check a coat. And even if I did, on principle tip jars have become so...",Barney
984,"Funny story, Barney was grinding with this girl all night...",Ted
985,FINE! Just... eh. (Leaves),Barney
986,That's a handy new trick. (They run up to the dance floor),Ted
987,(Yelling) I'M REALLY GLAD YOU GUYS CAME OUT TONIGHT.,Ted
988,"(Yelling) YOU KNOW DUDE, CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING? IT KIND OF HURT THAT YOU GUYS DIDN'T INVITE ME OUT (Lily's asleep on his shoulder) I MEAN I KNOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE I GOT ENGAGED BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO BE ASKED.",Marshall
989,"I'M SORRY, I JUST ASSUMMED YOU...",Ted
990,THEY PLAYED SOME GOOD SONGS TONIGHT.,Barney
991,--HAD OTHER PLANS. I MEAN LATELY...,Ted
992,"I KNOW, I KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SUDDENLY WE'RE LIVING IN TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS. MAYBE YOU'VE GOT MORE IN COMMON WITH BARNEY.",Marshall
993,WHAT?,Barney
994,YOU CRAZY? YOU THINK I LIKE GOING TO THOSE CLUBS? I'D SO MUCH RATHER GO TO YOUR FRUITY LITTLE WINE TASTING.,Ted
995,"Oh, my god...I'm going to barf. Where's my purse, where's my purse? (Sleeps) I'm okay.",Lily
996,PROBLEM IS... YOU CAN'T DO ANY OF THAT COUPLE STUFF UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO DO IT WITH. AND THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO FIND THAT SOMEONE IS BY GOING OUT DOING STUPID SINGLE STUFF WITH BARNEY.,Ted
997,WHAT?,Barney
998,"BUT MAN, WHEN I FIND HER. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME BADASS WINE TASTINGS.",Ted
999,IT'S A PLAN! HEY MAYBE IT'LL BE THAT CUTE COAT CHECK GIRL!,Marshall
1000,"YEAH, MAYBE IT WILL BE.",Ted
1001,"YOU KNOW, TED, I DON'T SAY THIS NEARLY ENOUGH BUT REALLY...",Marshall
1002,THAT PLACE MAKES GREAT SALADS!,Barney
1003,Guess what came in the mail today?,Lily
1004,Our costumes? Do they rule?,Marshall
1005,They rule. And yours is 100% wool so you won't get hypothermia like last year.,Lily
1006,Tarzan nipple blue.,Marshall
1007,"You know what I love about Halloween? It's the one night of the year chicks use to unleash their inner ho-bag. If a girl dresses up as she a witch, she's a slutty witch. If she's a cat, she's a slutty cat. If she's a nurse...",Barney
1008,She's a slutty nurse.,Barney
1009,"Robin, what are you doing for Halloween?",Marshall
1010,"Oh, I don't know. Probably hanging out with Mike, this guy I've been seeing.",Robin
1011,Mike? There's a Mike? You have a boyfriend? You haven't told us?,Lily
1012,"No, I mean, he's not my boyfriend. He's just this guy I've been seeing for a couple of weeks.",Robin
1013,So why haven't we met him?,Marshall
1014,We're not really ready to go public yet.,Robin
1015,How about we go about a Halloween double-date?,Lily
1016,"I don't know, we were kinda thinking about staying at home and dressing up as naked people.",Robin
1017,"Come on, Robin, trot our your new fella. Let us judge and evaluate him behind your back. It'll be fun.",Lily
1018,"Hey, Ted, you'll never guess what happened?",Marshall
1019,Your costumes came.,Ted
1020,"Our costumes...yes, that is why we're best friends.",Marshall
1021,"Hey, Ted, what are you doing for Halloween?",Robin
1022,Well.,Ted
1023,What?,Robin
1024,Every Halloween Ted waits for the Slutty Pumpkin.,Lily
1025,That's right.,Ted
1026,What's the Slutty Pumpkin?,Robin
1027,"You mean, who is the Slutty Pumpkin? It was four years ago.",Ted
1028,I was at this Halloween party up on the roof of our building. I'm about to call it an early night when out of nowhere appeared this girl in the sexiest pumpkin costume.,Ted
1029,"Wait, how can a pumpkin costume be sexy?",Robin
1030,It was carved in strategic places.,Ted
1031,"So, uh, we're at the bar and I see her mix kahlua...",Ted
1032,Kahlua and root beer,Lily
1033,A cocktail she invented herself.,Marshall
1034,And she...,Ted
1035,And she called it the Tootsie Roll.,Barney
1036,"Hey, can I please tell this story? So we had this instant connection. She gave me her number, but then something...",Ted
1037,Guys! Something went terribly wrong.,Ted
1038,Happy Halloween.,Lily
1039,"Sonny, where's Cher?",Ted
1040,Cher?,Lily
1041,"Right here, babe.",Marshall
1042,I just met the perfect woman. She's funny. She's beautiful. She loves Star Wars.,Ted
1043,Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. What's her take on Ewoks?,Marshall
1044,Loves them.,Ted
1045,Oh good. I don't know why people are so cynical about Ewoks. The Rebellion would have failed without the Ewoks.,Marshall
1046,"Get this, she's a marine biologist. She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.",Ted
1047,"Oh, penguins are cool, kinda like black and white Ewoks. I approve.",Marshall
1048,"Hey, where's my, uh, Kit Kat? I put it right here on this table.",Ted
1049,"I don't know, but we have plenty of chocolate here.",Lily
1050,"No no no, you don't understand. I need that Kit Kat. She wrote her number on that wrapper. Where is it?",Ted
1051,Uh-oh.,Lily
1052,"Hey, Dracula. Come on. Give me your candy. Gimme!",Ted
1053,Where's the Kit Kat? Where's the Kit Kat!,Ted
1054,"Never found her number, never saw her again. But every year they have a Halloween party up on the roof so that's where I'll be.",Ted
1055,"You know, Ted, it's been four years. She could be engaged or married or, God forbid, fat.",Barney
1056,"I don't know, I got a feeling. This could be the year. Halloween is a night of wonder and magic.",Ted
1057,"OK, bring the mockery. Fine, I can take it. Come on, wouldn't it be the coolest story ever if the Slutty Pumpkin turned out to be my future wife?",Ted
1058,"Oh, on the off chance that that could happen, maybe we should stop calling her the Slutty Pumpkin.",Lily
1059,Can't wait.,Ted
1060,"So, what do you think?",Marshall
1061,"<em>(repeats like a parrot)</em> So, what do you think? <em>(squawks)</em>",Lily
1062,"Wow! Marshall, you wearing eye liner?",Ted
1063,"Oh, yeah. Weirdly hot, right?",Marshall
1064,We are so gonna win the costume contest this year.,Lily
1065,"First prize, $50 gift certificate at the bar.",Marshall
1066,And how much did you pay for your costumes?,Ted
1067,$100,Marshall
1068,(<em>like parrot</em>) Each.,Lily
1069,"Well, I think you guys look great.",Ted
1070,"What are you going as? Oh, like I even have to ask.",Lily
1071,"Hey, I want the Slutty Pumpkin to recognize me and she knows me as a hanging chad.",Ted
1072,What? She thought it was hilarious.,Ted
1073,"Yeah, four years ago, but nobody remembers what the hell a hanging chad is.",Lily
1074,What a sad commentary on our national attention span that we could forget such a turbulent time in our political history.,Marshall
1075,"All right, Polly gotta pee.",Lily
1076,Again?,Marshall
1077,Where are you going?,Ted
1078,It's an elaborate costume.,Marshall
1079,"No, no, not again. Not this year. You're going as my wingman. Flight suit up!",Barney
1080,No thanks. I'm sticking with the hanging chad.,Ted
1081,"Oh you're dangerous, Maverick. Your ego's writing check your body can't cash. OK. Here's the plan, and I crap you not. I'm getting us into the Victoria's Secret Halloween party. Trust me, by the end of the night, your chad will not be hanging.",Barney
1082,"We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year. Tonight, I'm going up to the roof, I'm gonna have a few beers, I'm gonna wait for the Slutty Pumpkin. That's just what I do.",Ted
1083,"Hm, (putting up left hand) Victoria's Secret models prancing around in bras and panties, or (putting up right hand) Yale preppies reuniting their stupid a capella group. What's that left hand? Right hand sucks? Word.",Barney
1084,I'm heading up to the roof.,Ted
1085,"Well, boys, looks like it's just the three of us. What's that? Self-five? Nice. (high fives himself) We out.",Barney
1086,"Hey, Chad, how's it hanging?",Robin
1087,"Hey, word play. Funny.",Ted
1088,<em>(to Barney as he walks by her out the door)</em> Whoo.,Robin
1089,<em>(to Lily)</em> Nice outfit.,Robin
1090,I'm a parrot.,Lily
1091,You sure are.,Robin
1092,Where's Mike?,Lily
1093,He's meeting me here. I ran late covering the Halloween parade in the Village. There are like a zillion gay pirates this year.,Robin
1094,"Seriously, does my eye liner look OK?",Marshall
1095,"Yes, it's weirdly hot.",Lily
1096,"Uh, you know, Mike and I joked about doing something together but we decided not to dress up.",Robin
1097,"Oh, geez.",Robin
1098,"Ah, everyone, this is Michael. Th-that is not his real hair.",Robin
1099,"You thought I was...Oh, I was just kidding. I gotta stop making jokes in e-mails. It's so hard to convey tone.",Robin
1100,I can't believe you talked me into this.,Barney
1101,I didn't. You followed me up here.,Ted
1102,This party sucks. There are seven chicks here.,Barney
1103,There are six chicks here.,Barney
1104,"Relax, the night is young. It's gonna get better.",Ted
1105,Arr-gyle.,Lily
1106,Arrr-by's,Lily
1107,Actually I kinda need this hand to eat.,Robin
1108,"It's so nice to meet you, Mike. You guys are really cute together.",Lily
1109,This cheeseburger is so...,Robin
1110,"I think you won the dish-off tonight, baby. This steak totally bitch-slapped my pork chop.",Lily
1111,That might be true but your rice pilaf kicked my spinach in the crotch so hard it threw up a little bit.,Marshall
1112,"Oh, well, that's good. I'm OK, thanks.",Robin
1113,I'm just really feeling this cheeseburger.,Robin
1114,"Dude, I'm kind of in the zone here.",Robin
1115,Oh for God's sake. <em>(Lily grabs Mike's hand and eats food from his fork)</em>,Lily
1116,Really tasty.,Lily
1117,Hey.,Barney
1118,"So, what does a fella have to do to get lei'd around here? Yeah.",Barney
1119,It isn't funny if you explain the joke.,Barney
1120,Let's bail.,Barney
1121,"Oh, Barney, come on, I'm having fun. It's really great seeing these guys again.",Ted
1122,Name one person you know at this party.,Barney
1123,"Well, there's ninja, back of horse. Where's front of horse? That guys a riot. Where is he?",Ted
1124,"OK, I'm leaving, but just know that this Victoria's Secret party is on a yacht. And what will be sticking to that yacht? The Barnacle. (points to self)",Barney
1125,Really? That's the nickname now?,Ted
1126,"Yeah, the Barnacle.",Barney
1127,The Barnacle.,Ted
1128,That's it. Barnacle out. (Barney walks away),Barney
1129,"Have fun, Barnacle.",Ted
1130,"So, do you like Mike?",Robin
1131,Do you like Mike?,Lily
1132,Of course I do. Why?,Robin
1133,It just doesn't seem like it. You won't share your food. You won't wear a costume.,Lily
1134,"Ah, Lily, you know me, I'm just not into all that couple-y stuff.",Robin
1135,"OK, I know that stuff looks dumb from the outside, but it's kinda the greatest thing in the world when you're a part of it. If you just give it a chance, you might like it.",Lily
1136,Are you trying to get me to join a cult?,Robin
1137,"Robin, Mike likes you. If you don't start meeting him halfway, you're gonna lose him.",Lily
1138,What?,Robin
1139,"Look, it's Halloween. Just put on the girlfriend costume for the night.",Lily
1140,"OK, what am I supposed to do? Buy him a giant teddy bear or something?",Robin
1141,How about you start by sharing dessert.,Lily
1142,"I can share dessert. He better want the brownie sundae, but yeah, yeah, I can totally share.",Robin
1143,"Barney. What, you're back?",Ted
1144,That's right.,Barney
1145,In a totally new costume.,Ted
1146,"Every Halloween, I bring a spare costume in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party. That way I have a second chance to make a first impression.",Barney
1147,What's with the face?,Barney
1148,"It's half you're pathetic, half I have to pee.",Ted
1149,So go to the bathroom.,Barney
1150,"No, there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the Slutty Pumpkin.",Ted
1151,"So pee off the roof. Ooh, Ted, pee off the roof.",Barney
1152,"Come on, Ted, who are you going to listen to? Me or Mr. Goody-goody over there.",Barney
1153,"A little to the left, Marshall. Lily, squat down.",Robin
1154,This is gonna be a slaughter. None of these other costumes even come close to ours.,Marshall
1155,Take the damn picture. (<em>squawks)</em>,Lily
1156,Got it.,Robin
1157,I still think we should have won as Sonny and Cher. Maybe if I had worn that red dress. Ha! If I could turn back time.,Marshall
1158,"Wow, this sundae looks so good I could eat the whole thing.",Robin
1159,"But, um, I would much rather share this small, one-scoop sundae with you, Mike.",Robin
1160,"Apple tart, excellent choice, Lilypad.",Marshall
1161,"Thanks, Marshmallow.",Lily
1162,"Well, let's dig in, Mi... Mi... Microwave Oven.",Robin
1163,Let me guess. Every guy has used the lei'd line on you tonight.,Barney
1164,I apologize for my gender. Let me make it up to you. Make you a drink.,Barney
1165,I'm also a horny devil. (pointing to horns on top of head) Yeah.,Barney
1166,"No, you found it. I came with you. Go on.",Robin
1167,I cannot get enough of it.,Robin
1168,I'm crazy and you're crazy for tiramisu.,Robin
1169,"No, no, no, I mean it just sounds a little bit weird, doesn't it? We love tiramisu. Is it really a group activity, loving tiramisu? Right?",Robin
1170,So this Italian place? How's their cannoli?,Marshall
1171,"See there, hungry.",Robin
1172,"Hey, is that Gary Oldman? (pointing behind Mike and Marshall)",Robin
1173,Brain freeze.,Robin
1174,OK Victoria's Secret party right now.,Barney
1175,Nope.,Ted
1176,"Come on, I can't stand to watching my delusional friend waste another precious Halloween. The Slutty Pumpkin is not coming.",Barney
1177,She might.,Ted
1178,Oy.,Barney
1179,"Come on, Barney, this is not about the odds, this is about believing. This girl, she represents something to me, I don't know, hope.",Ted
1180,Wow. I did not understand a word you just said. Lingerie models on a boat!,Barney
1181,<em>(shrugs)</em> See ya.,Ted
1182,"No, see ya. <em>(evil laughs, sparks something in his hands</em>) Ow.",Barney
1183,Wanna drink the melty part?,Robin
1184,"Hey, I thought we were gonna follow those bread crumbs back to my place, Hansel",Robin
1185,I like being with you.,Robin
1186,"Well, who uses ink? Sorry. OK, I'm a bit set in my ways. That doesn't mean that this won't work.",Robin
1187,"Wait, are we breaking up?",Robin
1188,She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.,Ted
1189,"Uh, excuse me, this is gonna sound crazy, but I met someone up on this roof four years ago and they mixed that cocktail and they loved penguins. By any chance, was that you? It's you. I was crazy but I can't...",Ted
1190,"You are such a loser. Come on, I came back for you, Ted. I penguin-suited up to show you the error of your ways. And to score hula girl's number. Check and check.",Barney
1191,Unbelievable.,Ted
1192,"Yes, it is.",Barney
1193,"What? No no, that's some other guy and he was a kick-ass fighter pilot",Barney
1194,"Yeah, well, you did, thanks.",Barney
1195,"Uh, I don't think so. I earned it fair and square. I'm calling you.",Barney
1196,But how will you know it's me? I'm a master of disguise. Yeah.,Barney
1197,Nice.,Ted
1198,"Come on, Ted, Victoria's Secret party now. Let's go.",Barney
1199,I'm staying.,Ted
1200,Fine. Fine. (puts his flipper up towards Ted),Barney
1201,What are you doing?,Ted
1202,I'm flippering you off.,Barney
1203,"Sweetie, I'm so sorry.",Lily
1204,"Seriously it's not a big deal. He wanted to be a 'we,' and I wanted to be an 'I'. Dudes are such chicks. You guys, I'm fine.",Robin
1205,Oh yeah!,Marshall
1206,Wait. What did he say?,Marshall
1207,"Oh, who cares, Marshall? We won!",Lily
1208,"Gay pirate, where are you getting that from?",Marshall
1209,"OK, I just want everybody here to know that I'm not a gay pirate. I have sex with my parrot all the time. That came out wrong. Oh yeah, it doesn't matter! We won!",Marshall
1210,"I love you, Marshmallow.",Lily
1211,"I love you too, Lilypad.",Marshall
1212,"You guys, let me get a picture.",Robin
1213,I had a feeling I'd find you here.,Robin
1214,"Hey. If you're here for the Shagarats, you just missed the fourth encore.",Ted
1215,I never played any team sports,Robin
1216,Are we playing 'I never' cuz there's nothing left but peach schnapps.,Ted
1217,I played tennis in high school. You know why? Because it was just me out there. I couldn't even stand playing doubles. I just got dumped.,Robin
1218,"Man, that sucks.",Ted
1219,"Yeah, it's OK. I wasn't that into him. Story of my life. Everyone else is all falling in love and acting stupid and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me. Why don't I want that more? I want to want that. Am I wired wrong or something?",Robin
1220,"No. Look, you didn't want to be with me so clearly you have abysmal taste in men.",Ted
1221,But you're wired just fine.,Ted
1222,"Well, what if I'm just a cold person? Tonight, Mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but I couldn't be Gretel. Why can't I be Gretel?",Robin
1223,Because you just haven't met the right Hansel yet. One day you're gonna meet a guy who's gonna make you want to look like a complete idiot.,Ted
1224,Really?,Robin
1225,"Yeah, he's out there somewhere, just like the Slutty Pumpkin. (echoes) pumpkin-pumpkin...",Ted
1226,"How do you do this, Ted? How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up.",Robin
1227,"Well, I'm pretty drunk. Look, I know that odds are the love of my life isn't going to magically walk through that door in a pumpkin costume at 2:43 in the morning but it seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know, sit and wait.",Ted
1228,Scoot.,Robin
1229,Oh my God.,Marshall
1230,"I know, I'm still shaking.",Lily
1231,"What the? Haha, joke's on you, I have a cold.",Barney
1232,Are you guys OK? Marshall (yelling over to bartender): Another round and back it up for me and Lily.,Robin
1233,What happened?,Ted
1234,"We saw something, up in the apartment.",Marshall
1235,Something bad.,Lily
1236,"I don't know what it is, but margaritas make me sexy.",Marshall
1237,"Oh, mucho sexy. You quiero Marshall.",Lily
1238,Oh my God.,Lily
1239,What was it?,Ted
1240,"Only the craziest, meanest looking mouse you've ever seen.",Marshall
1241,"Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse. That was a huge cockroach.",Lily
1242,"Baby, it was a mouse. It had a whiskers.",Marshall
1243,"But those things coming out of his head, those were antennae",Lily
1244,Marshall ran away from a cockroach.,Barney
1245,"It, it was a mouse.",Marshall
1246,"Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.",Barney
1247,"Ooh, my story's on. Ted, pay attention. Carl, turn it up.",Robin
1248,"I'm here with Ellen Pierce, New York's premiere matchmaker. Ellen, your company, Love Solutions boasts a 100% success rate. What's your secret?",Robin
1249,"Love Solution's Ellen Pierce, a beacon of hope for New York city's lovelorn. Robin Scherbatsky...",Robin
1250,Was that chick at the end really a client?,Barney
1251,Yes.,Robin
1252,We're signing up.,Barney
1253,What?,Ted
1254,"Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot. That's a perfect cocktail. Shake well, then sleep with.",Barney
1255,I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up. It's the man version of getting a cat.,Ted
1256,"No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur and only mammals have fur.",Marshall
1257,It was a cockroach.,Lily
1258,"Come on, Lily, the only way that that was a cockroach was if it was wearing the skin of a mouse it just k*ll.",Marshall
1259,Oh my God.,Lily
1260,Come on.,Barney
1261,"Ted, hurry, you gotta help me. My boat is sinking.",Barney
1262,What?,Ted
1263,My boat is sinking.,Barney
1264,You have a boat?,Ted
1265,Your boat is sinking. That was good.,Ted
1266,"Come on, Ted, this is an incredible opportunity. We'll meet our soulmates, nail 'em and never call them again. (chuckles)",Barney
1267,"Gosh, thanks, Ellen. I sure hope this works. I'm so done with the single life, all the games, the meaningless sex.",Barney
1268,"That is so true, Ellen. I really think I'm ready to stop being a me and start being a we.",Barney
1269,"It's kinda hard to talk about with Ted here, but I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night when the tears come. Ellen, can you help me find her?",Barney
1270,What?,Barney
1271,"Oh my God, people do that.",Barney
1272,What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?,Barney
1273,"OK, Ted, let's go.",Barney
1274,"Ah, no thanks. I don't need an algorithm to meet women. It's New York City. You know, plenty of fish in the sea.",Ted
1275,"That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?",Ted
1276,Do you take credit cards?,Ted
1277,"OK, it's back and this time we got a good look.",Lily
1278,"Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that.",Barney
1279,It's bigger now. It's been feeding.,Marshall
1280,We were just upstairs watching TV.,Lily
1281,Ah gosh.,Marshall
1282,"OK, let's do this.",Lily
1283,"Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over.",Marshall
1284,So did you get a good look at it?,Barney
1285,"Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton like a roach...",Lily
1286,"But it has mouse-like characteristics. Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail.",Marshall
1287,"So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?",Robin
1288,It's a cockamouse.,Lily
1289,What?,Robin
1290,It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know...,Lily
1291,Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha?,Barney
1292,That's impossible. That simply can't happen.,Robin
1293,"Oh, but it can.",Lily
1294,And it has,Marshall
1295,And it's pissed.,Lily
1296,"Dude, is everything OK? You left the front door open.",Ted
1297,There was no time.,Marshall
1298,"So Love Solutions, did you meet the love of your life?",Robin
1299,She said it'd take three days. It's been five days. Should I be worried?,Ted
1300,"Oh, just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.",Lily
1301,Did you just use my name as a verb?,Ted
1302,"Oh, yeah, we do that behind your back. Ted-out: to overthink. Also see Ted-up. Ted-up: to overthink something with disastrous results. Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when",Barney
1303,"OK, I get it. Don't worry, I'm not gonna ted anything up or out. I'll just give it a few more days.",Ted
1304,"Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.",Ted
1305,You said it was gonna be three days.,Ted
1306,Hm.,Ted
1307,"Yeah. When someone says you're gonna meet the perfect woman in three days, you gotta put that in your datebook, so...",Ted
1308,There are no women for me out there? I thought you said there were 8.,Ted
1309,"But, I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute. I'm a cute architect.",Ted
1310,"Well, I'm not.",Ted
1311,"No. You're messing with me, right?",Ted
1312,There's a 9.6 right there.,Ted
1313,What about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?,Ted
1314,So he sucks.,Ted
1315,"Oh, sure, it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?",Ted
1316,He's a whole new species. The cockamouse.,Lily
1317,And it's the size of a potato.,Marshall
1318,"So, what, now it's a cockapotatomouse?",Robin
1319,Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cockamouse.,Marshall
1320,"My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.",Ted
1321,"Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman.",Barney
1322,And like the majestic seahorse it's hermaphroditic.,Marshall
1323,Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.,Lily
1324,"For as much as we know about the cockamousse, there are still so much we don't know.",Marshall
1325,"Well, we know that there's no such thing as a cockamouse. What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking.",Robin
1326,So you really don't believe in the cockamouse?,Marshall
1327,"Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know, um, like the Loch Ness Monster.",Robin
1328,"If by 'like the Loch Ness Monster,' you mean, totally exists and is awesome, then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster.",Marshall
1329,"It's diet is not unlike our own, grains, cereals and it's awfully fond of cheese...",Marshall
1330,"OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin.",Ted
1331,You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny.,Barney
1332,"All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?",Ted
1333,Hi.,Ted
1334,I'm Architect Mosby. Sorry I just wanted to say my job too.,Ted
1335,"Hi, I'm Ted.",Ted
1336,I have a kind of mole on my back. It's probably nothing but I'm a cautious guy.,Ted
1337,"Sorry about that, Summer Breeze is my guilty pleasure song.",Ted
1338,"Oh, it's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend at brunch.",Ted
1339,"It's the best, as long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies.",Ted
1340,"Hey, this may sound weird but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off so I'm gonna ask you now. Do you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?",Ted
1341,Friday night?,Ted
1342,"Wow, you're getting married. Congratulations.",Ted
1343,I'm really sorry I asked you out. If just felt like there might be this weird connection between us. How crazy am I coming off here?,Ted
1344,"Well, by some million to one sh*t, and I'm not rooting for this, you wind up not getting married this weekend, give me a call.",Ted
1345,I'm sure you do.,Ted
1346,"Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap. You think the road runner's gonna fall for it?",Robin
1347,"OK, we get it. You're skeptical. But Marshall and I, we're believers. We believe.",Lily
1348,"Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome. You got the Bermuda triangle, ghosts, Big Foot.",Marshall
1349,Bad maps. Creaky houses. Hillbilly in a gorilla suit.,Robin
1350,Aliens.,Marshall
1351,"Oh, come one, you gotta give me aliens. Stonehenge. Area 51. There's alien crap all over the place.",Marshall
1352,You can't be serious.,Robin
1353,"My friend, you just poked the bear.",Marshall
1354,"So, my 9.6, beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged.",Ted
1355,Oh.,Robin
1356,"Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.",Lily
1357,"Yeah, it was a long sh*t. I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mine, but I don't know...",Ted
1358,"Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.",Lily
1359,"Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game.",Barney
1360,"On the night of July 2nd, 1947, conditions were clear over Roswell, New Mexico.",Marshall
1361,Oh geez.,Robin
1362,"Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you. Dr. O'Brien.",Marshall
1363,What?,Ted
1364,"When suddenly, an array of",Marshall
1365,The doctor will see you now.,Barney
1366,"What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?",Ted
1367,Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday.,Lily
1368,"Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.",Ted
1369,(chuckles) Happy ending.,Barney
1370,"Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a sh*t.",Ted
1371,"All right, see you later. Happy hunting.",Barney
1372,"Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse.",Lily
1373,"Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles.",Barney
1374,Oh my God!,Marshall
1375,Holy crap. We got it! What do we do with it?,Lily
1376,"Calm down, I have a plan. I told my friend, Sudeep, about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department. But it has to be alive.",Marshall
1377,"Wait, no no. They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean. Shouldn't we just b*at it to death with a bat?",Lily
1378,Hello again.,Ted
1379,"Go ahead, Sarah, you can tell me anything.",Ted
1380,Anything else?,Ted
1381,"Wait, then you're still getting married.",Ted
1382,But we're a 9.6.,Ted
1383,"OK, I, I went to Love Solutions and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer that you and I are a 9.6. Your fiance's only an 8.5.",Ted
1384,I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious? The woman who set you up with your fiancÃ© thinks we're a better match.,Ted
1385,"Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?",Ted
1386,"See, we're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other.",Ted
1387,Calm down! You're my only match! There was a computer and there were 8 fish in the sea full of lesbians.,Ted
1388,"Didn't used to. There was math, I got confused.",Ted
1389,You're right.,Ted
1390,"Brace yourself, dude. This is gonna blow your mind hold.",Marshall
1391,What?,Marshall
1392,"Wait, but if it's not here, that means...Lily.",Marshall
1393,Robin.,Lily
1394,What?,Robin
1395,Oh my God. It's real.,Robin
1396,"Oh, is it? Do something.",Lily
1397,What the hell was that? You trying to get it drunk?,Lily
1398,It was the only think I could think of.,Robin
1399,Lily thank God.,Marshall
1400,"Lily, I love you.",Marshall
1401,"Robin, open the window!",Marshall
1402,It can fly.,Robin
1403,"Be free, mutant beast. I'll miss this private w*r of ours. I grew to admire your tenacious...Oh my God, it's headed this way.",Marshall
1404,Hi Ellen. I think I want my money back.,Ted
1405,"Come on, Ellen, I mean, a pint of ice cream isn't that a bit clichÃ©?",Ted
1406,This isn't hopeless. You're gonna find someone for me.,Ted
1407,"I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive. You just have to get back out there and keep looking.",Ted
1408,You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be up on that wall one of these days.,Ted
1409,Yes I will,Ted
1410,"Point is, something good is going to happen to me. Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen.",Ted
1411,Of course you should. And now you're gonna do it for free.,Ted
1412,"Sorry, Mr. Madsen.",Lily
1413,Plugging in.,Ted
1414,Saving game.,Marshall
1415,You guys will never believe what just happened to us.,Lily
1416,I don't even believe it myself.,Robin
1417,We were in Queens and we decided to stop by my apartment.,Lily
1418,I could see how you would think that but I have to have my own place. It's an independence thing.,Lily
1419,When was the last time you were there?,Robin
1420,Three months ago.,Lily
1421,What? It's like fat pants. You hope you never have to use 'em but you're glad to know they're there.,Lily
1422,What the hell?,Lily
1423,What?,Robin
1424,This is my apartment.,Lily
1425,Where?,Robin
1426,Right here.,Lily
1427,What the hell?,Lily
1428,"Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant.",Robin
1429,"No, no, this was my apartment. My dresser was right...",Lily
1430,That's my dresser! And this is my closet.,Lily
1431,"Yes, you know me?",Lily
1432,"Yeah, I know, the bangs were a mistake. Where's my stuff? Waitress: It's all in the back. We could wrap it up for you. You want it to go?",Lily
1433,This is my apartment!,Lily
1434,No way. You're making this up.,Ted
1435,"Yeah, the building would have had to give you some sort of notice.",Marshall
1436,When?,Lily
1437,"Well, still, legally, they can't just toss you out onto the street. You have a lease.",Marshall
1438,"OK so I didn't have a written lease as such but, but go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy.",Lily
1439,She may be 98 years old but she's still...,Lily
1440,"She's dead, isn't she?",Lily
1441,My apartment is a Chinese restaurant. What am I gonna do?,Lily
1442,Come live with us.,Ted
1443,Really?,Lily
1444,Of course.,Ted
1445,"You sure about this, Ted?",Marshall
1446,"Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything.",Ted
1447,"No, it's like it'll change everything. Oh, Ted, you are so screwed.",Barney
1448,What? What are you talking about?,Ted
1449,And why is that girl checking you out?,Robin
1450,"Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged",Barney
1451,"Yeah, so?",Ted
1452,"So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be?",Barney
1453,"Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right?",Robin
1454,"Yeah, we've talked about it.",Ted
1455,"So, when Lily and I get married, who's gonna get the apartment?",Marshall
1456,"Oh, that's a tough one. You know who I think could handle a problem like that?",Ted
1457,Who?,Marshall
1458,Future Ted and Future Marshall.,Ted
1459,Totally. Let's let those guys handle it.,Marshall
1460,Dammit Past Ted,Ted
1461,"You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out.",Barney
1462,That's crazy. They're not edging me out. Marshall's my best friend.,Ted
1463,One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.,Ted
1464,"Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment.",Barney
1465,"Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?",Robin
1466,Sort of on a date with her.,Barney
1467,What?,Ted
1468,"I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile. (evil laugh) But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.",Barney
1469,All right.,Ted
1470,You're going to the hospital?,Robin
1471,"No, see, he's gonna go back over there and I'm gonna call him and he's gonna pretend that it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.",Ted
1472,"Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney.",Robin
1473,"Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck.",Barney
1474,"So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?",Robin
1475,"He's gonna want the apartment. I'm gonna want the apartment. It's gonna lead to an argument, so no.",Ted
1476,"Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it.",Robin
1477,I should really make this call.,Ted
1478,"Ooh, can I do it?",Robin
1479,"Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy.",Barney
1480,"Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?",Barney
1481,"Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff.",Robin
1482,"An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy.",Barney
1483,Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?,Barney
1484,"Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.",Robin
1485,"Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there.",Barney
1486,See you guys later.,Barney
1487,"Ah, this'll be nice, the three of us living together. I think it's a good setup.",Ted
1488,"Man, this coffee's great. It's really great. Too great.",Ted
1489,What happened to Shocky?,Ted
1490,"What's this? Lily: My coffeemaker from my apartment. Makes great coffee, right?",Ted
1491,"Yeah, definitely. I mean, so does Shocky.",Ted
1492,Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kinda rusty.,Marshall
1493,"Yeah, no, it did. I mean, I kinda liked the rusty taste. I'm used to it. I don't know.",Ted
1494,"Also Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock you.",Marshall
1495,"No. You gotta admit, that shock, wakes you up in the morning",Ted
1496,You know what else wakes you up in the morning? Coffee.,Marshall
1497,That's great. You're right. Roomies! I love it.,Ted
1498,They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.,Ted
1499,"Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.",Barney
1500,"Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she!",Robin
1501,It's not just the coffeemaker.,Ted
1502,Done. The painting's done.,Lily
1503,That is great.,Marshall
1504,Nice.,Ted
1505,Where do you wanna hang it?,Marshall
1506,"I don't know. Um, over the piano?",Lily
1507,"Yeah, that would be a good place for it. Too bad the swords are there. We kinda love those swords.",Ted
1508,"Well, those swords have been up there a long time.",Marshall
1509,"I know, right? I'd really miss them too. So, maybe Marshall's room?",Ted
1510,OK.,Lily
1511,He was gonna take the swords down. Can you believe that?,Ted
1512,"Ted, why don't you just talk to him? He's your best friend.",Robin
1513,"One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.",Robin
1514,"Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike.",Barney
1515,"Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?",Ted
1516,"You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big.",Barney
1517,"What, like buy a new sofa?",Ted
1518,Bigger.,Barney
1519,"Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law.",Barney
1520,"A lemon law, like for cars.",Robin
1521,"Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now.",Barney
1522,Hi Katie. Barney.,Barney
1523,"Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.",Barney
1524,"Man, Ted's been acting weird. He started labeling all his food. He even carved &quot;Ted&quot; into that block of cheese.",Lily
1525,"Yeah. Well, now it's Ed's.",Marshall
1526,He's not cool with me moving in.,Lily
1527,"No, that's not it. I mean, you basically lived here all along. Ted loves you.",Marshall
1528,"So, what's he PMS'ing about?",Lily
1529,I don't know. But when he's ready to talk to me about it he'll come and talk to me about it.,Marshall
1530,Are you kidding? You guys never talk about anything.,Lily
1531,He'll just let it fester under the surface until he does something big and passive-aggressive.,Lily
1532,You clearly don't know Ted.,Marshall
1533,Your English phone booth arrived.,Marshall
1534,"Oh, awesome. It's great, right?",Ted
1535,"Yeah, I guess. Just not sure if Lily's gonna like it.",Marshall
1536,"Well, I like it, so I'm just gonna keep it right here, if that's cool.",Ted
1537,"Of course, we all live here so we should all be able to have things the way we want them.",Marshall
1538,Exactly.,Ted
1539,Great,Marshall
1540,Terrific.,Marshall
1541,You like the phone booth. It stays. I like this painting so I'm just gonna hang it...right here on the wall.,Marshall
1542,"Oh, so it's like that, is it?",Ted
1543,"Bring, bring.",Marshall
1544,"Yeah, it's like that.",Marshall
1545,I want this apartment.,Ted
1546,"Well, I want it too.",Marshall
1547,"No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing!",Barney
1548,"For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society.",Robin
1549,"No, wrong, lemon law is awesome.",Barney
1550,"It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great.",Robin
1551,"OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy.",Barney
1552,You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?,Barney
1553,"Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate.",Robin
1554,"Bad move, Scherbatsky.",Barney
1555,"Hi, have you met Robin?",Barney
1556,Hi.,Robin
1557,"All right Marshall, we're deciding right now who gets this apartment. It may lead to an argument, but we're settling this.",Ted
1558,Or we could flip a coin.,Marshall
1559,"Yeah, let's flip a coin.",Ted
1560,Flip it.,Marshall
1561,"OK, I'm flipping it, here I go.",Ted
1562,Flip it.,Marshall
1563,"OK, here I go.",Ted
1564,Flip it.,Marshall
1565,"I'm flipping. But before I do, I just wanna say something. You didn't even wanna move in here in the first place. You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies.",Ted
1566,That was five years ago. Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter. Oh snap. What else you got?,Marshall
1567,"OK, I'm flipping. Heads or tails.",Ted
1568,You don't need two rooms,Marshall
1569,"Heads or tails, Marshall. Like you need two rooms?",Ted
1570,We might be starting a family soon.,Marshall
1571,"Oh, no you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're in law school. It's gonna be at least three years.",Ted
1572,"It could be sooner, we're not that careful with our birth control Two-zip.",Marshall
1573,"Oh, come on, you know damn well I move out that room's going unused.",Ted
1574,"Oh, and I suppose you'll get a new roommate? Who's it gonna be? Barney? You know he cooks naked.",Marshall
1575,"Yeah, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the swords down.",Ted
1576,We were bros! These swords represent our bro-hood. And you took 'em down to make room for your fiance's stupid painting?,Ted
1577,"My fiancÃ©...suddenly, she's my fiancÃ©.",Marshall
1578,"I deserve this apartment, Marshall.",Ted
1579,No more than I do.,Marshall
1580,"Great, so let's flip for it.",Ted
1581,Flip it.,Marshall
1582,"So, is this how we're deciding who gets the apartment?",Ted
1583,I guess so.,Marshall
1584,How are we doing this exactly? Is this like to the death?,Ted
1585,We should probably figure that out.,Marshall
1586,"It's OK, it's OK.",Ted
1587,Can I observe something?,Ted
1588,That this is kinda awesome?,Marshall
1589,Totally.,Ted
1590,I can't believe we didn't do this before.,Marshall
1591,I know!,Ted
1592,Thank you.,Robin
1593,It's a nice place. It's good to know the future has ribs.,Robin
1594,Just a second.,Robin
1595,Hello.,Robin
1596,"(laughs) Time's running out, Scherbatsky. Last chance for the lemon law.",Barney
1597,Leave me alone.,Robin
1598,"4:56, 4:57, 4:58.",Barney
1599,We're only just getting to know each other.,Robin
1600,Say I'm right and this could all be over. This could be your call from the hospital.,Barney
1601,Sorry.,Robin
1602,"No, I would never do that. I don't wanna go anywhere. I'm all yours.",Robin
1603,That was awesome.,Marshall
1604,I know.,Ted
1605,Do it again.,Marshall
1606,"OK, but this time, jump up and I'll swipe your legs.",Ted
1607,"Look. Here's why I should get the place. You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates. And on top of that I could be homeless. Does that seem fair?",Ted
1608,"Oh, boo-freakin-hoo.",Marshall
1609,What?,Ted
1610,"Woe is me. I'm not married yet. My ovaries are shrinking. Ted, if you wanted to be married by now you would be but you're not. And you know why? Because you're irrationally picky. You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.",Marshall
1611,Anhedonic?,Ted
1612,Anhedonic. It means you can't enjoy anything.,Marshall
1613,The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this.,Ted
1614,"I know, this rules.",Marshall
1615,"Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down.",Marshall
1616,"That's OK, it led to this totally rad sword fight, didn't it?",Ted
1617,Yeah it did.,Marshall
1618,You remember when we first got these swords?,Marshall
1619,It was the day we moved in.,Ted
1620,"Congratulations, Marshall. We live in an apartment with swords on the wall.",Ted
1621,"List of lifelong dreams, you're not half as long. Crap. I'm missing one of the screws for this table",Marshall
1622,"Just use this wood glue, it'll hold.",Ted
1623,Yeah.,Marshall
1624,"Oh God, I'll be right there.",Robin
1625,"Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go. My friend's been stabbed with a sword.",Robin
1626,"No, I swear that was a real call. I just...Oh forget it.",Robin
1627,I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fiancÃ©.,Marshall
1628,"Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fiancÃ©? I'm kidding. Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment. Marshall: But you fought so bravely for it.",Ted
1629,"I wasn't fighting for the apartment. I was fighting for...I don't know...for everything to stay the way it is. But I'm not gonna get that, so, seriously, take the place, it's yours.",Ted
1630,Is she OK?,Robin
1631,They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine.,Marshall
1632,"So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie.",Barney
1633,"What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie.",Barney
1634,"Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O.",Barney
1635,"It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law.",Barney
1636,But you're totally...,Robin
1637,Just let him have this one.,Ted
1638,That's us.,Marshall
1639,A sword fight?,Lily
1640,"On Monday, I'm gonna have to tell my kindergarten class who I teach not to run with scissors that my fiancÃ© ran me through with a frickin' broad sword.",Lily
1641,"Well, just to be fair, it didn't go all the way through.",Marshall
1642,"I'm sorry, is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me?",Lily
1643,You're right. I'm sorry. We were fighting to see who gets the apartment. And I won.,Marshall
1644,"Uh, you didn't win. I gave it to you.",Ted
1645,"Uh, you know, if I tried...",Marshall
1646,"Wait wait wait wait wait. I don't want that apartment. It's a boy apartment. It's full of swords and videogames, and kinda smells like dude. It's fine for now, but when we get married, I wanna start a new life with you in a new place.",Lily
1647,Gonna miss the old place.,Marshall
1648,I will too. We're not getting married for like a year.,Lily
1649,"Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem. Let that guy deal with it.",Ted
1650,Totally.,Marshall
1651,Maybe it's the massive bl*od loss talking but I'm starving.,Lily
1652,Let's go get some dinner.,Marshall
1653,I know just the place.,Lily
1654,"Chinese restaurant, I still don't believe it.",Ted
1655,"I told you. OK, a toast.",Lily
1656,"Life is full of changes. One day you have an apartment, the next day it's a house of dumplings. But the important stuff doesn't change. To the important stuff.",Lily
1657,And to the lemon law.,Barney
1658,Self-clink.,Barney
1659,"And by the way, I bought these glasses. I bought them at Ikea. These are my glasses.",Lily
1660,I love this song. I haven't heard this in forever.,Marshall
1661,I'm pretty sure this is a mixed tape you made me in sophomore year.,Lily
1662,"Lily, your apartment makes the best Shanghai dumplings.",Robin
1663,"Well, I just ralphed.",Lily
1664,How much did you guys drink last night?,Robin
1665,Not how much? What.,Ted
1666,"The Thankstini. A fun and delicious new novelty drink I invented. Cranberry juice, potato vodka and a bouillon cube. Tastes just like a turkey dinner.",Barney
1667,It's like Thanksgiving in my mouth.,Marshall
1668,"You want a good holiday drink, try his Kwanzaapolitan.",Ted
1669,The shuttle's here!,Marshall
1670,He hasn't been back home to Minnesota since Christmas. He's a little excited.,Lily
1671,"Baby, we're holding up the shuttle, do you have everything you need? Toothbrush, pajamas, underpants. Underpants.",Marshall
1672,"So, Lil, Marshall's family. Whole weekend with the future in-laws, you excited?",Ted
1673,"Yeah, no, it'll be fun.",Lily
1674,"Lily, you just said, &quot;yeah, no.&quot;",Robin
1675,"Did I? No, I, I love Marshall's family.",Lily
1676,"But, yeah, no, it'll be great.",Lily
1677,You just did it again.,Ted
1678,"Yeah, no, shut up.",Lily
1679,"Wait, so you're not going home for Thanksgiving.",Robin
1680,"No, I have to work on Friday. You?",Ted
1681,"I'm Canadian, remember? We celebrate Thanksgiving in October.",Robin
1682,"Oh, right, I forgot you guys are weird. You pronounce the word out, &quot;oat&quot;",Ted
1683,"You guys are the world's leader in g*n violence, your healthcare system is bankrupt and your country is deeply divided on almost every important issue.",Robin
1684,Your cops are called Mounties.,Ted
1685,"So, probably hanging out with Barney then?",Robin
1686,"No, Barney's got his own Thanksgiving tradition.",Ted
1687,"Thanksgiving in a strip club, who's in? The Lusty Leopard has a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet. Plus, they do this thing. Heather dresses up as a pilgrim and Misty dresses up as an Indian, and they share a meal.",Barney
1688,"Oh, Barney.",Lily
1689,"I'm sorry, Native American.",Barney
1690,"I think I'm gonna go to a homeless shelter, serve food.",Ted
1691,That's awesome.,Robin
1692,"Yeah, I thought I'd just spend the day giving back, you know, doing some good.",Ted
1693,Canceling out Barney.,Barney
1694,Exactly.,Ted
1695,Where are all my underpants?,Marshall
1696,Did you check your suitcase?,Lily
1697,Let's go.,Marshall
1698,"Hello, we're home!",Marshall
1699,"Wow, I forgot how tall you guys are.",Lily
1700,Here I am. (Lily raises her hand),Lily
1701,You're gonna go play hockey?,Lily
1702,With a basketball?,Lily
1703,We invented it. It's the most dangerous and awesome sport in the world.,Marshall
1704,Baskiceball? Not iceketball?,Lily
1705,You wish.,Marshall
1706,"Oh, well maybe that's just 'cause you haven't seen me play.",Lily
1707,"I don't know honey, it's not really a sport for a girl.",Marshall
1708,"Well, that's funny because your brother throws like a girl.",Lily
1709,This is gonna be great.,Robin
1710,"I know. I'm so psyched we did this. Look at all these people, giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man. These have got to be the best people in New York.",Ted
1711,"Excuse me, guys. Coming through.",Barney
1712,Barney?,Ted
1713,"Well, hi guys.",Barney
1714,What are you doing here?,Ted
1715,"Oh, just the Lord's work.",Barney
1716,But you're Satan.,Ted
1717,"Guys, OK, look, I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here. I think it's important to help the less fortunate. I'm the Angelina Jolie of incredibly hot guys.",Barney
1718,"This is a joke, right? You don't actually volunteer here.",Robin
1719,I'm on it.,Barney
1720,"Wait, so, this is real. Barney does this?",Ted
1721,"That's because I was trained by the best, Kendall.",Barney
1722,"Anyway, uh, we're psyched to be here, Kendall. What do you need us to do?",Ted
1723,"What? Ted: We're volunteers, we're unpaid help. Can you really ever have enough unpaid help?",Robin
1724,"Come on, we just wanna help out.",Robin
1725,"Kendall, they're cool.",Barney
1726,"OK, well, I better get out there. There's a lot of food to give out. And a lot of smiles.",Barney
1727,Thank you. It'll go great with my...I just love it.,Lily
1728,"Oh, I make this great frisee and endive salad with a coriander lime vinaigrette.",Lily
1729,Seven-layer salad?,Lily
1730,Six cups of mayonnaise? That can't be right.,Lily
1731,"Oh my God, there is some serious baskiceball going on out there. Dad totally nailed Marcus in the face with a snowball, which is a foul because you only get one snowball per possession, so I nailed him in the shin with my skate and I totally dunked it.",Marshall
1732,"You having fun? Lily: Yeah, but I kinda miss you. Could you stay in here for a little bit?",Marshall
1733,"Yeah, yeah yeah, no problem, it's halftime.",Marshall
1734,Go.,Lily
1735,Thanks baby.,Marshall
1736,"Oh, isn't this great? Can't you see why everybody from my high school stays in this town?",Marshall
1737,"Hey Marvin, you're the dorko, dorko!",Marshall
1738,"Man, it's amazing out there. I've done so much good today, I've got like a soul boner.",Barney
1739,Yesterday you said the best feeling on earth was getting your toes sucked. Then you requested a high-five with your foot.,Robin
1740,"Hey, Barn? What do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit?",Ted
1741,"(laughs) You wanna scoop stuffing your first day out? Hello, NFL, can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude.",Barney
1742,"OK, I finished the gummy bear layer of the salad. What's next?",Lily
1743,Potato chips.,Lily
1744,"Baby? Uh, you know, I hadn't really thought about it at all.",Lily
1745,"Well, I just ralphed.",Lily
1746,"Yeah, I mean, I'm way too young to have a baby, right?",Lily
1747,(staring at turkey) Oh my.,Lily
1748,"That's a big baby, Judy.",Lily
1749,(laughs nervously) Twins. Twins!,Lily
1750,This is crazy. When did it get so hard to do charity work?,Ted
1751,I do charity work all the time. Remember when I said I'd find you a girlfriend.,Robin
1752,Ha ha. Delightful. How is that little project coming along anyway?,Ted
1753,I'm working on it. I'm gonna introduce you to that girl you've been staring at.,Robin
1754,"What? That's crazy, I haven't been staring at any girl...",Ted
1755,Have you met Ted?,Robin
1756,"Hi, I'm the aforementioned Ted, and this is...",Ted
1757,... gone.,Ted
1758,Hi.,Ted
1759,"Well, I've been...nothing. I do nothing.",Ted
1760,"Oh, um, I'm not his girlfriend. I used to be but, um, I just wasn't enough woman for Ted, emotionally or sexually. Oh my God.",Robin
1761,"So, Amanda, what do you need us to do?",Ted
1762,Got it. Consider it sorted.,Ted
1763,"Hey, we're in business.",Robin
1764,"Hey, Barney's not gonna get all the glory today.",Ted
1765,Let's start with this one.,Ted
1766,Yeah.,Robin
1767,Three months! Three months?,Lily
1768,He's been drinking his milk.,Marshall
1769,And she's already pregnant again.,Lily
1770,"Dad, you're embarrassing me.",Marshall
1771,"Yeah, well, well, not literally because, you know, I'm keeping my name.",Lily
1772,"Well, we haven't actually decided anything yet so...",Marshall
1773,"No, I've decided and I'm keeping my own name.",Lily
1774,"Oh, sure, in St. Cloud but our kids aren't gonna be growing up in St. Cloud. Right, baby?",Lily
1775,"Why not St. Cloud? I mean, I loved growing up St. Cloud. St. Cloud is a great place to have a childhood.",Marshall
1776,"Oh, so is New York.",Lily
1777,What? It is. And we grew up just fine. And we grew to the proper size and then we stopped.,Lily
1778,"Hey, Amanda, what's this box for?",Ted
1779,"In your car, um, then you'll take it...",Ted
1780,People donated this food thinking it was going to feed the hungry.,Ted
1781,"But, Marshall, you love New York.",Lily
1782,"Yes, I do. But you always said that when we had kids, you wanted to move out of Manhattan.",Marshall
1783,"Yeah, to Brooklyn.",Lily
1784,Why are we even talking about this? This is way down the road.,Marshall
1785,I need to go to the restroom.,Lily
1786,"Lily, the restroom's the other way.",Marshall
1787,Lily.,Marshall
1788,Lily!,Marshall
1789,"So, wait, not only have you not done any good for anyone today, you're actually helping someone steal from the homeless. You know, Ted, it's called Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking. Damn.",Barney
1790,"Yeah, Right. Thanks.",Barney
1791,Barney.,Ted
1792,"Yeah, what's up?",Barney
1793,You have a time sheet. No one else has a time sheet.,Ted
1794,"Yeah, so.",Barney
1795,"All right, let me see that.",Ted
1796,That's my private personal business!,Barney
1797,Court-mandated community service.,Ted
1798,That's my private personal business.,Barney
1799,I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church.,Barney
1800,You peed on a church?,Ted
1801,I peed in an alley which happened to have a church which I did not see because I was drunk.,Barney
1802,"Oh, you are evil.",Ted
1803,"Now, all's right with the world again.",Robin
1804,"OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW.",Barney
1805,When's the last time either of you did any good? Huh?,Barney
1806,"Kendall, ah, Kendall, Amanda is stealing Portobello mushrooms from homeless people.",Ted
1807,Those are for the hungry.,Ted
1808,Mushrooms. Mushrooms. Portobello mushrooms for everybody! Take them and run! They're very expensive!,Ted
1809,"Happy Thanksgiving. As in check out the chick buying the knock-up test everybody, wonder what must be going through her head. Yeah, well, since you asked, a family of mayonnaise-guzzling giants is trying to suck me into their suburban nightmare. And there's a solid chance that I have an Ericksen the size of a 15-pound turkey growing inside of me.",Lily
1810,Fantastic.,Lily
1811,I'm sorry I just yelled at you. You mind if I use your bathroom?,Lily
1812,So what do you do when you have to...?,Lily
1813,You can't fire a volunteer.,Ted
1814,Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.,Robin
1815,I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip.,Barney
1816,Volunteer of the year!,Barney
1817,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just tell me, I'll do it.",Ted
1818,"Ted, I'm glad you asked.",Barney
1819,Surprisingly good.,Robin
1820,Right? I told you so.,Barney
1821,Public urination. Who gets arrested for public urination?,Ted
1822,Lily's been arrested.,Marshall
1823,"Thanks, Pete.",Marshall
1824,You all right? Lily: No. I embarrassed myself in front of your family and now I'm celebrating Thanksgiving in probably the most depressing place ever.,Marshall
1825,"Well, I'm glad that you're safe. Hey, weird question, why did you drive three miles down Route 23 and take a pee behind a convenience store?",Marshall
1826,"OK, I'll tell you but before I do, promise me that we are not gonna move to St. Cloud, Minnesota, promise.",Lily
1827,"Look, I'm not suggesting that we move here tomorrow. I'm just...",Marshall
1828,Just promise.,Lily
1829,Why do you want me to promise you that?,Marshall
1830,Because I don't fit in here. I'm not eight feet tall and I don't think you can call it a salad if it has Funyuns in it.,Lily
1831,"I'm Funyuns and mayonnaise and gummy bears and baskiceball and I love St. Cloud. And yes, there is a part of me that would like to move here someday, and why are we having this discussion in a jail cell on Thanksgiving?",Marshall
1832,Pete arrested me before I could look at it.,Lily
1833,Whoa.,Marshall
1834,Yeah.,Lily
1835,"Lily, we can't let our kids play baskiceball. Baskiceball is really dangerous.",Marshall
1836,"Yeah, what are the rules to that game, anyway? Marshall: There are no rules, we just wail on each other.",Lily
1837,"Look, I don't wanna be exactly like my family, and don't take this the wrong way, but I don't wanna be exactly like your family either.",Marshall
1838,"Great, now I'm crying. Look, we may have some really big decisions to make in about 10 seconds but right now, I don't care where our kids grow up as long as they have you for a father.",Lily
1839,"Gosh, I hope you're the father. Just a little joke to lighten up the mood.",Lily
1840,What does it say? Lily: I'm afraid to look.,Marshall
1841,Thank God.,Lily
1842,(to Pete) And hey!,Lily
1843,Ted. Are you listening? You're a good guy.,Robin
1844,"You wanna know why I have to work tomorrow? My firm's designing an executive lounge for a tobacco company. In the fight against cancer, I'm on the side of cancer.",Ted
1845,"OK, Ted, I found a way for you to help someone, to do some good. This is Walter, and Walter is homeless. And Walter would like a lap dance.",Barney
1846,Are you joking?,Ted
1847,I never joke about the sublime art of burlesque entertainment.,Barney
1848,"No, Barney, that's insane. Sir, would you like me to buy you a ticket to the buffet.",Ted
1849,"Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners. You know where he hasn't been? To heaven with Samantha. Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need. Now buy this man a lap dance.",Barney
1850,You said you wanted to see the joy in someone's eyes.,Robin
1851,"You know, I don't think I'm gonna watch.",Ted
1852,"Here you go, Walter. Happy Thanksgiving.",Ted
1853,"Happy Thanksgiving, guys.",Ted
1854,Thanksgiving in November. Weird.,Robin
1855,"Uh, no thanks. You want some yams?",Ted
1856,I'm Ted.,Ted
1857,Still Ted.,Ted
1858,"We're not really doing shots, are we?",Ted
1859,I hope not.,Lily
1860,"No, no.",Barney
1861,These look kinda like bl*od.,Lily
1862,"OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?",Marshall
1863,That's ridiculous.,Barney
1864,"I'm serious. Think about it. He always wears black, we never see him in the daylight, only after dark.",Marshall
1865,"Oh my God, that does describe a vampire, or you know, a bartender.",Robin
1866,"Well, I should go get dressed.",Robin
1867,"Where are you going, buddy? Hot date?",Ted
1868,"I'll say, she's going out with a billionaire.",Lily
1869,"Lily, I told you not to call him that.",Robin
1870,"Wait, you're really going out with a billionaire?",Ted
1871,He's not a billionaire. He's a hundred millionaire. Why do people always round up?,Robin
1872,"So, uh, where's Thurston Howell taking you?",Ted
1873,A charity dinner.,Robin
1874,"Yeah, $2000 a plate.",Lily
1875,"$1500, Stop rounding up. And it's for third world hunger.",Robin
1876,You gonna put out?,Barney
1877,What? There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills.,Barney
1878,I think my soul just threw up a little bit.,Lily
1879,"Well, I'm gonna be late. You guys have fun. Bye.",Robin
1880,See ya.,Ted
1881,Bye.,Lily
1882,You OK?,Marshall
1883,"Sure, why?",Ted
1884,I don't know. Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire.,Marshall
1885,"OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for...",Ted
1886,What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go.,Barney
1887,"Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?",Ted
1888,Daddy's home.,Barney
1889,Daddy's home?,Ted
1890,Yeah.,Barney
1891,"You want us to go over there right now and say to those girls, 'daddy's home.' Really think about that, Barney.",Ted
1892,"Hm. Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.",Barney
1893,"OK, think about this, is there even a single item on the menu that has garlic in it?",Marshall
1894,Garlic fries.,Lily
1895,"OK, well, I'll get back to you.",Marshall
1896,"Oh, daddy's back. See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that...",Ted
1897,"(holding up small yellow piece of paper) Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy, huh?",Barney
1898,That worked. I hate the world.,Ted
1899,"Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.",Barney
1900,Doo-doo.,Marshall
1901,Totally.,Barney
1902,"So, I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped.",Ted
1903,Oh yes it can.,Barney
1904,Interesting,Marshall
1905,"Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style.",Barney
1906,"So, what? You want me to do a sh*t.",Ted
1907,Oh no. I want you to do five shots.,Barney
1908,"Oooh, more interesting.",Marshall
1909,"Barney, I think you've officially...",Ted
1910,"No, don't think. Do.",Barney
1911,"Ted, he's right. You overthink. Maybe you should overdrink.",Marshall
1912,"Ah, Lily, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being?",Ted
1913,"Guys, you are being immature and moronic and drink, drink, drink",Lily
1914,"Let me tell you something about this brain, OK?",Ted
1915,Even alcohol cannot stop this brain.,Ted
1916,"I love it, I love it, I love it.",Barney
1917,"This brain, dear mortals, is no ordinary brain.",Ted
1918,This is a superbrain.,Ted
1919,This brain is unstoppable. This brain...,Ted
1920,"OK, what the hell happened last night?",Ted
1921,"You really don't remember, Superbrain?",Marshall
1922,"I drank all five, bitch.",Ted
1923,(laughing) I love drunk Ted.,Marshall
1924,Marshall thinks you're a vampire.,Ted
1925,No dibs. (Lily puts index finger on her nose),Lily
1926,Oh. (Marshall puts index finger on his nose),Marshall
1927,No....Dammit.,Barney
1928,How quickly you all forget. I haven't puked since high school. I am vomit-free since ninety-three. Vomit free since ninety-three. That's funny. I'm funny.,Ted
1929,Who are you calling?,Lily
1930,Robin.,Ted
1931,"Oh, bad idea.",Marshall
1932,"No, no, that's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk. You do things you would never do in a million years if you were sober.",Barney
1933,Says every girl you've ever slept with.,Lily
1934,(pointing to Lily) Say what?!,Marshall
1935,"Hello Robin, it's Ted.",Ted
1936,Oh hi Ted.,Robin
1937,"Hello Robin, it's Ted.",Ted
1938,Hi Ted. Sounds like you're having fun.,Robin
1939,"Robin, have I ever told you that I'm vomit-free since ninety-three?",Ted
1940,"Listen, Ted, I can't really talk right... '93? Dude, that's impressive.",Robin
1941,"I don't say this enough, but you're a great woman, and a great reporter. You should be on 60 Minutes. You should be one of the minutes.",Ted
1942,That's sweet and odd. But I'm kinda on a date right now.,Robin
1943,"Yeah, and I disagree with Barney. Just 'cause this guy is spending a lot of money doesn't mean you have to put out. Take it slow, Robin, take it slow. Slow.",Ted
1944,Bye Ted.,Robin
1945,Slow.,Ted
1946,"Wow, right, that's why we don't do shots.",Marshall
1947,Friends don't let friends drink and dial.,Lily
1948,I need that phone back.,Ted
1949,You'll get this back at the end of class.,Lily
1950,"Ding, class dismissed. Here you go, kid, you call whoever you want.",Barney
1951,Thank you kind sir. At least someone appreciates the fact that I'm doing and not thinking. And now I don't think I won't not go to the bathroom.,Ted
1952,"Was that necessary? He is not making smart decisions. Barney: Exactly. It's like, what's he gonna do next. I don't know, but I want to find out.",Lily
1953,Cheap Trick? Oh Ted.,Marshall
1954,"Hello again, Ted.",Robin
1955,"Hey, it's me again.",Ted
1956,(singing along with jukebox) Plain to see again.,Ted
1957,(singing along with jukebox) Please can I see you every day?,Ted
1958,(yelling to everyone in bar) I love everyone in this bar.,Ted
1959,"And we love you, drunk Ted.",Marshall
1960,(singing along with jukebox) I'm a fool again.,Ted
1961,(singing along with jukebox) I fell in love...,Ted
1962,Ted?,Robin
1963,"Well, that explains the ankle.",Ted
1964,And then we brought you home and put you to bed.,Lily
1965,Was there anyone else in there with me?,Ted
1966,There's a girl in there.,Lily
1967,I know.,Ted
1968,And a pineapple.,Marshall
1969,I know.,Ted
1970,Who is she?,Lily
1971,I don't know.,Ted
1972,What the hell happened to my jacket? Marshall: Whoa.,Ted
1973,"That girl in there is alive, right? Ted: I should call Barney, maybe he knows what happened.",Lily
1974,Hello.,Barney
1975,Why are you sleeping in our tub?,Ted
1976,The porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling.,Barney
1977,"Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?",Lily
1978,"Don't worry, I slept through it. (laughs) I totally didn't sleep through it. For a little girl, you've got a big t*nk.",Barney
1979,How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around one.,Marshall
1980,"Oh, you put Ted to bed all right.",Barney
1981,You guys take care of me. You guys are the best. I love you guys so much.,Ted
1982,"Good night, Ted.",Lily
1983,"Love you too, buddy.",Marshall
1984,I'm back baby doll!,Ted
1985,"Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now.",Barney
1986,"All right, game face on. Carl, two more. All right, all right, what do we think of this one?",Barney
1987,I think....,Ted
1988,"Ehhh! Trick question, no thinking. You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride.",Barney
1989,Bring it.,Ted
1990,Have you met Ted?,Barney
1991,You're calling Robin.,Barney
1992,I'm calling Robin.,Ted
1993,"Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her.",Barney
1994,Oh yeah? What you gonna do?,Ted
1995,"If you complete that call, I will set your coat on fire.",Barney
1996,You're bluffing.,Ted
1997,"Hello, Robin, it's Ted.",Ted
1998,"Ted, for the last time, stop.",Robin
1999,Ted!,Robin
2000,You set me on fire.,Ted
2001,"Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast. You got robbed, this is a blend.",Barney
2002,You set me on fire. And who's the girl in my bed?,Ted
2003,And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?,Marshall
2004,Who is she?,Barney
2005,I have no idea.,Ted
2006,Nice.,Barney
2007,You really don't know who that is?,Ted
2008,"No, after I hosed you down with a beverage g*n, I brought you back here.",Barney
2009,I better not have gotten b*rned.,Ted
2010,Did any of you write that?,Ted
2011,"(reading what's on Ted's arm) Hi, I'm Ted, if lost, please call...Who's number is that?",Lily
2012,I don't know.,Ted
2013,"Dude, call it. Hold on, I'm gonna make some popcorn.",Marshall
2014,"OK, you can call now. God, this is intense, I love it.",Marshall
2015,"Uh, hi, who is this?",Ted
2016,It's Ted.,Ted
2017,"Barney, you've always taken care of me. You are a gentleman and a scholar. Go into my stable and take my finest stallion. He's yours, his name is Windjammer.",Ted
2018,"Sleep it off, bra.",Barney
2019,"I'm back, baby doll! Ted: And I am gonna throw up.",Ted
2020,"I threw up? My streak is over. Vomit-free since '05 doesn't sound good. Sorry, Carl, go on.",Ted
2021,"Carl, did you know the word karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra? Isn't that hauntingly beautiful? Are you a vampire? Carl: I am cutting you off. Go home and get some sleep, Ted.",Ted
2022,"Yeah, sun's gonna come up soon. Wouldn't want to be around for that, would we?",Ted
2023,"Hey, how easy do you think it'll be to sneak into the zoo? I have to see some penguins, like right now.",Ted
2024,That tickles.,Ted
2025,"Thanks Carl. We can't just be friends, we're attracted to each other and we both know it.",Ted
2026,"Me and Robin. Me and Robin, I have to make one more call.",Ted
2027,"Hey, it's me again. Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life, so shy don't you come over to my apartment and we'll think of something stupid to do together? Really? Great. Wait, really? Great.",Ted
2028,Thanks Carl.,Ted
2029,It's Robin. That's Robin in there.,Ted
2030,Did you guys?,Marshall
2031,"Oh come on. You've gotta give me this one. Those five shots got you farther with Robin than your brain ever did. See what happens when you don't think? You do! More importantly, you do Robin. Come on.",Barney
2032,"All right, right over here.",Lily
2033,"Still, what does this mean? Are we dating now? I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it...",Ted
2034,"Someone get him a sh*t, he's thinking again.",Barney
2035,"Maybe it's not such a bad idea to think about this one. You and Robin went down this road before, you got dinged up pretty bad.",Marshall
2036,You know who might have something to say about Ted's future with Robin? Robin. Go wake her up.,Lily
2037,Wake her up and say what?,Ted
2038,Daddy's home.,Barney
2039,Good luck buddy.,Marshall
2040,Hello.,Ted
2041,"Ted, it's Robin.",Robin
2042,Are you sure?,Ted
2043,"Hey, Robin, how are you?",Ted
2044,"Ted, I think you and I should have a talk about those phone calls last night. Do you mind if I swing by?",Robin
2045,Ask her about the pineapple.,Marshall
2046,"Yeah, sure, come on over.",Ted
2047,Thanks.,Robin
2048,"No, wait, don't, no.",Ted
2049,She's coming over. Crap.,Ted
2050,"Wait, this is k*ll me. We have to find out who that girl is.",Lily
2051,Daddy's home.,Barney
2052,"OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy.",Barney
2053,Ladies.,Barney
2054,I love everyone in this bar.,Ted
2055,"What are you doing in the men's room? What am I doing in the ladies' room? Oh right, I came in here 'cause I thought I was gonna throw up.",Ted
2056,I did not.,Ted
2057,And the streak continues. Vomit-free since '93.,Ted
2058,"Sorry, Trudy, go on.",Ted
2059,What? The karaoke? Domo arigato.,Ted
2060,Do it.,Ted
2061,"I'm something stupid, do me.",Ted
2062,"Hey, can I call you sometime? Trudy: OK.",Ted
2063,Why do they call it karaoke anyhow? Was it invented by a woman named Carrie Okie? These are the kinds of things I think about. Trudy: Karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra.,Ted
2064,That's hauntingly beautiful.,Ted
2065,"Hey, it works.",Ted
2066,I need to make one more call.,Ted
2067,"Hey, it's me again.",Ted
2068,"Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life.",Ted
2069,"Dammit, Trudy, what about the pineapple? Sorry.",Marshall
2070,"Uh, Robin's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom.",Ted
2071,"No, that's not my girlfriend. Look, it's complicated.",Ted
2072,"No, I'm not married. Um, I'll explain after you hide.",Ted
2073,Hi.,Ted
2074,Hey guys.,Robin
2075,Robin.,Barney
2076,Hi Robin.,Lily
2077,Top of the morning.,Barney
2078,"Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was very drunk.",Ted
2079,"No kidding. Those calls were really weird. Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk.",Robin
2080,Let's go get a snack.,Lily
2081,I love to snack.,Marshall
2082,I'm good.,Barney
2083,"Come on, those calls weren't that weird.",Ted
2084,"(recording form phone) Robin! Come hang out! OK, I'm gonna make this sound until you come hang out.",Ted
2085,That goes on for three-and a half minutes.,Robin
2086,Without a breath? That's gotta be some kind of record.,Ted
2087,"Ted, you can't do this. Please, we're to be friends and now you're making it all confusing.",Robin
2088,"No I'm not. Look, I just turned off my brain for the night. Nothing's changed, you've moved on, I've moved on.",Ted
2089,"Really, you moved on?",Robin
2090,"Yes. What, you don't believe me?",Ted
2091,"Oh, OK.",Ted
2092,"Trudy, come on out.",Ted
2093,"Wait, you were with someone last night? Ted: Yeah, Trudy, she's cool.",Robin
2094,"Trudy, come on out.",Ted
2095,"Seriously, it's OK. This is so Trudy. She's really shy, I think.",Ted
2096,Trudy?,Ted
2097,"Hi Trudy, I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you. You're right, she is shy.",Robin
2098,I'm not making this up. She must have climbed out the fire escape.,Ted
2099,"Whatever, whatever. I don't care what you think.",Ted
2100,"Then why did you hide her from me? Ted: Wow, you're good. Did anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 Minutes?",Robin
2101,"Yes, you did, last night.",Robin
2102,Really? Well.,Ted
2103,"Get some sleep, Ted. You had a long night. And don't feel bad, I've woken up with worse.",Robin
2104,"Yeah, that's right...a limo.",Ted
2105,"Oh, man, Ted, this is great.",Robin
2106,"Okay, people, let's talk strategy. Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked. This year we party together or not at all. Now, I sifted through your party submission and I narrowed them down to these five.",Ted
2107,Question?,Barney
2108,"Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.",Ted
2109,"But you enjoyed the e-vite, right? Thas an actual picture of my pants.",Barney
2110,Yeah.,Lily
2111,"We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City and that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year.",Ted
2112,"All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?",Lily
2113,Mary Beth?,Robin
2114,"Oh, she works in my office. She seems like she might be into me. She's always finding reasons to hug me. So tonight...",Ted
2115,"People often ask me &quot;Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?&quot;",Barney
2116,By who? Who asks you that?,Lily
2117,"And the answer is right here... my own, personal &quot;get psyched&quot; mix. Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong. It should be all rise, baby. Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline. Bam.",Barney
2118,It's working.,Lily
2119,I am definitely getting psyched.,Ted
2120,"Oh, God. I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage. Must do robot.",Marshall
2121,Let's do this!,Barney
2122,"Yes! Let's! Oh, driver?",Ted
2123,"Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now. That's awesome.",Barney
2124,How do you guys know each other?,Robin
2125,"Oh, we rode in his cab one time. It's a long story.",Ted
2126,"Hey, what are we waiting for? We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.",Barney
2127,"Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up.",Robin
2128,"Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun.",Robin
2129,Bye.,Lily
2130,See ya next year. Go get 'em.,Ted
2131,"Well, this kind of sucks.",Lily
2132,"Okay, nobody get down. We knew this going in. We're a man down. That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder. Ranjit! Party number one.",Ted
2133,Party number one!,Barney
2134,"I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets. If you think we can b*at that, you got some brass ones.",Marshall
2135,"Hey, we've got four more parties to hit. If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.",Ted
2136,"We didn't really get a chance to meet. I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall.",Lily
2137,My word.,Marshall
2138,"You're, you're friendly.",Lily
2139,"Oh, no.",Lily
2140,"So, Barney, who's your new friend?",Ted
2141,Natalya.,Barney
2142,"So, where are you from, Natalya?",Lily
2143,She... Who knows? The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?,Barney
2144,Isn't she awesome?,Barney
2145,"How are your feet doing, baby?",Marshall
2146,"Okay, I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep. Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?",Lily
2147,"Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us. I need you to power through the pain.",Ted
2148,"Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.",Lily
2149,"It's true. I can hear them. What's that, little boys? What's that? You wanna go for a... rock?",Barney
2150,Ranjit! Party number two.,Ted
2151,Party number two? Not so good.,Ted
2152,Let's go back to party number one.,Marshall
2153,"No, no turning back. Ranjit, party number three.",Ted
2154,"Oh, wait, wait, wait. We have to turn around. We left Natalya.",Barney
2155,"Barney, none of us really liked her.",Lily
2156,What?!,Barney
2157,Sorry.,Lily
2158,"Oh, very nice, Lily. You know, she is a guest in this country. So while you may chose to turn your back on her, I choose to turn my front on her. What up?",Barney
2159,I'm sorry about Barney.,Ted
2160,"Me, too. (<em>Ted's phone starts ringing)</em> Hey, Robin.",Ted
2161,"Ted, Derek stood me up.",Robin
2162,"Ranjit, turn it around.",Ted
2163,"Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this. You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up.",Robin
2164,"No, this is perfect. It's meant to be. We're all back together.",Ted
2165,What happened?,Lily
2166,Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal. Who works on New Year's Eve? Okay. Now I feel worse. I was really looking forward to this night. This sucks.,Robin
2167,"Oh, dude, not now!",Marshall
2168,What? She needs to get psyched. Fine.,Barney
2169,Maybe I should just go home.,Robin
2170,My finger slipped.,Barney
2171,"Look, Robin, you're not going home. Come on, it's New Year's Eve. Look, so your date fell through. So what? What do you need a date for? Someone to kiss at midnight? Fine. I'll kiss you at... a little bit after midnight.",Ted
2172,"Hi, I'm Robin.",Robin
2173,You're friendly. I haven't eaten dinner yet. Is there anything to eat in this thing?,Robin
2174,"That's it. I know what you're jonesing for. Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!",Ted
2175,"Oh, yes. Ted, you rock.",Robin
2176,"We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs?",Barney
2177,"Yeah, we like hot dogs.",Marshall
2178,"No. No. We are already behind schedule. Ted, come on. We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit.",Barney
2179,"Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.",Ted
2180,"Which is exactly how much time I need. Ranjit, stop the car.",Lily
2181,"Wait. Baby, what are you doing?",Marshall
2182,I'm going home.,Lily
2183,What? No!,Ted
2184,"I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't. There's a cab over there. I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.",Lily
2185,But... hot dogs.,Marshall
2186,"Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.",Lily
2187,"Okay, I'll go with you.",Marshall
2188,"No, baby. Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at... party number three.",Lily
2189,Are you sure?,Marshall
2190,"If I don't see you, happy new year.",Lily
2191,Don't say that. We'll find each other. We'll find each other.,Marshall
2192,I know we will. <em>(Lily leaves the limo)</em>,Lily
2193,Hell of a woman. Let's go get some hot dogs!,Marshall
2194,"Ranjit, party number three.",Ted
2195,"Oh, yeah! Look at us. Riding around in a limo. Eating hot dogs. It's like we're the president.",Marshall
2196,Hey. I'll bet you're feeling better now.,Ted
2197,"Oh, so much better.",Robin
2198,Guys. Is that Moby? I think that that's Moby.,Marshall
2199,No way.,Ted
2200,That's totally Moby. That's awesome.,Robin
2201,"Should I say something? I should say something, right? Moby! Hey, Moby!",Ted
2202,"Oh, my God. He's coming over. Everybody be cool. Everybody be cool.",Barney
2203,Hey.,Ted
2204,"What's up? Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?",Ted
2205,You want a ride?,Ted
2206,Welcome.,Ted
2207,"Big fan. Barney Stinson. So, uh... what about this party?",Barney
2208,"Wow, that sounds awesome.",Robin
2209,"Yeah, we'd love to.",Ted
2210,"Uh, Ted. Sidebar?",Marshall
2211,"Um... Moby, switch up, will you? Yeah, what's up?",Ted
2212,What about Lily?,Marshall
2213,Call her.,Ted
2214,I've been trying to call her. I can't get through. All the circuits are jammed.,Marshall
2215,"That's New Year's Eve for you. Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards...",Ted
2216,"No, I-I can't. Lily's waiting. I gotta... I gotta find her. Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.",Marshall
2217,But... Come on! Moby's party! Moby's party! Moby's par... Ranjit. Moby's party.,Ted
2218,"Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher. This mix is my pride and joy. I never leave home without it.",Barney
2219,Jan... Aah!,Barney
2220,"You're not Moby, are you?",Ted
2221,"Moby... the recording artist, Moby.",Robin
2222,"But when we said, &quot;Hey, Moby,&quot; you said, &quot;Yeah.&quot;",Barney
2223,So your name is Tony?,Ted
2224,Nah.,Ted
2225,"No, uh, we're good. We're good. Happy New Year, Not Moby.",Barney
2226,Why did we think that guy was Moby?,Barney
2227,"I don't know. I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.",Ted
2228,That's Marshall's phone. Hello.,Barney
2229,"Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.",Lily
2230,"Hey, sexy.",Barney
2231,"Barney, where's Marshall?",Lily
2232,He left his phone in the limo. He's out looking for you.,Barney
2233,What? Where?,Lily
2234,Party number three.,Barney
2235,"Well, I'm here at party number three and... Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in... Moby!",Lily
2236,Moby?! She's upstairs.,Barney
2237,"Lily, you have to get out of there this instant. That's not Moby.",Ted
2238,"Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo... Does he have a g*n?",Lily
2239,"Run! Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four. What are the odds?",Ted
2240,Who was that guy?!,Lily
2241,"Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.",Barney
2242,"Ranjit, drive!",Ted
2243,Party number three!,Ted
2244,"No, but I was just at party number three.",Lily
2245,"No, no, no, no you were at party number four. You must have looked at the list wrong.",Ted
2246,"Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for? It's time to... what? That's right, re-psych. Re-psy... Where's the...? Oh, my God! Not Moby took my &quot;Get Psyched&quot; mix!",Barney
2247,"Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it! Let it go. We need to get back on schedule.",Ted
2248,"Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?",Ted
2249,"Okay Okay, not a problem. He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time.",Ted
2250,I wish Marshall would call. I guess the circuits are jammed.,Lily
2251,"Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world. Everyone except Barney. Oh, sure, laugh. Laugh for Barney Stinson. Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze. Round and round it goes. And where's it all heading? Nowhere.",Barney
2252,Is this just 'cause you lost your &quot;Get Psyched&quot; mix?,Robin
2253,I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?,Barney
2254,"No. No, not tonight. Not in the limo. We got to stay psyched. Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's. (<em>singing...)</em> *sh*t through the heart And you're to blame, darling*",Robin
2255,It'll be fine. We'll be out of here in a jiff.,Ted
2256,"No. Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but...",Ted
2257,I'm not in love... We're just friends. Where are you getting that from?,Ted
2258,That's ridiculous. Wait. Really?,Ted
2259,I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.,Lily
2260,"Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party. It's no big deal.",Ted
2261,"The first time I rode in a limo I was five. I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral. I suppose, in a way, I still am.",Barney
2262,"Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here. I'm going to call Marshall.",Lily
2263,But he left his phone.,Ted
2264,Marshall! Marshall!,Lily
2265,I'm sorry about your girl.,Robin
2266,Sorry about your guy.,Ted
2267,"Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight. Did you forget about our little deal? Because I did not.",Robin
2268,"I did not, too.",Ted
2269,Derek. Hi. How's work?,Robin
2270,I'll give you some privacy.,Ted
2271,Marshall!,Lily
2272,"Okay, how's this for a plan? We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45. We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time.",Ted
2273,Marshall!,Lily
2274,"Give it a rest, Ted.",Barney
2275,Give what a rest?,Ted
2276,"Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve which is the single biggest letdown of a night every single year.",Barney
2277,Marshall!,Lily
2278,"Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around. We've still got ten minutes.",Ted
2279,"Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted. It doesn't exist.",Barney
2280,Marshall!,Lily
2281,Lily!,Marshall
2282,Holy crap.,Ted
2283,Marshall!,Lily
2284,I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually. So much to tell. I couldn't find Lily at party number three so I walked... I walked to the next party on the list.,Marshall
2285,Not Moby's party?,Ted
2286,"Yes, Moby's party. Check it out. He signed my shirt. And guess what I found. Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it. Yeah, I know. Come on.",Marshall
2287,Come on! Oh! Oh!,Barney
2288,"Baby, baby, I was so worried about you. Why didn't you call me?",Lily
2289,"I tried, baby. All the circuits were jammed. But wait, there's more. After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five. And so I went there, too, and it is awesome. I want to cry, it is so awesome. We have to go there.",Marshall
2290,How? We'll never get a cab.,Ted
2291,"Let's do this! Come on! In! Go, go, go!",Ted
2292,Natalya?,Lily
2293,"Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time. Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?",Barney
2294,"Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town. Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?",Ted
2295,"Move, you stupid taxi!",Lily
2296,Three minutes!,Marshall
2297,"Ranjit, put her in park. Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome, but it's not the best party in New York. 'Cause this is, right here.",Ted
2298,Cheers. Well said.,Barney
2299,Derek?! Derek.,Robin
2300,"Hey, uh, come on in.",Ted
2301,I can't believe you made it.,Robin
2302,"Here, you need a mint.",Barney
2303,"What the hell, man? I thought we had a deal.",Robin
2304,What about your guy? It's midnight. Go kiss him.,Ted
2305,"Eh, he kept me waiting. I can keep him waiting.",Robin
2306,"Well, a deal is a deal.",Ted
2307,Happy New Year.,Robin
2308,Happy New Year.,Ted
2309,Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?,Ted
2310,"Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah.",Barney
2311,"You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date.",Barney
2312,"Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?",Ted
2313,"Ted, it's a simile.",Barney
2314,"Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date, a $200 piece of chicken-slash-salmon will go uneaten. I gotta bring someone, but who?",Ted
2315,"Well, Derek and I just broke up.",Robin
2316,"No, that's terrible, are you OK?",Lily
2317,"Yeah, do you need a drink or something?",Marshall
2318,"Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed.",Robin
2319,"Don't b*at yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you.",Barney
2320,"Thanks, I feel a lot better. Think I'll get that drink now.",Robin
2321,"OK, guys, I gotta say something. I think my feelings for Robin may be resurfacing.",Ted
2322,"Oh, because they were buried in a shallow grave.",Lily
2323,"Not again. Come on, dude, we all know how this movie ends. Ted falls in love. Love kicks Ted in the sprouts. Roll credits.",Marshall
2324,"No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture. Fact.",Ted
2325,Robin was into me when we first met. Fact.,Ted
2326,"Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof. Fact.",Ted
2327,"On New Year's Eve, we kissed again. Fact.",Ted
2328,I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck,Ted
2329,"What I don't get is, why is Claudia marrying Stuart? She's way hotter than him. How way? Way way.",Barney
2330,"This wedding does sound pretty amazing though. Fancy hotel ballroom, everybody all dressed up.",Marshall
2331,"Ah, here we go.",Lily
2332,What?,Barney
2333,We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame.,Lily
2334,"Oh yeah, OK, that's a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments.",Marshall
2335,I thought so.,Lily
2336,"You know what, excuse me if I don't wanna get married barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-one's-gonna-drive-that-far. Yes, I want a ballroom and I want a band and I want shoes.",Marshall
2337,A little girl?,Lily
2338,What up?,Barney
2339,"Yes, but I'm the bride so I win.",Lily
2340,"Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together.",Marshall
2341,"Right. But I'm the bride, so I win.",Lily
2342,"Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years.",Barney
2343,"You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship is to celebrate someone else's successful one.",Ted
2344,"Well, makes sense.",Robin
2345,"So, with that mind, our friends Claudia and Stuart are having this crazy, black-tie wedding on Saturday. You wanna be my 'plus one'?",Ted
2346,"Ooh, 'plus one', you make it sound so romantic. Ted: Fine. You wanna be my date?",Robin
2347,"Your date? I'd love to. Um, how fancy are we talking about here?",Robin
2348,"Oh, you're gonna wanna bring your A game.",Ted
2349,"Oh, I'll bring it. I'll bring it so hard the bride's gonna look like a big white bag of crap.",Robin
2350,"Lily, I need a dress.",Robin
2351,"You're going. That's awesome. Oh my God, four days to find a dress?",Lily
2352,"I know, it's a su1c1de mission.",Robin
2353,"Well, if we leave now, we can still have a fighting chance. Let's do it.",Lily
2354,Bye babe.,Marshall
2355,"Whoa, did you see how fired up she was? I don't know, there's something there. And come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne. Who knows? Barney: Wow, Ted, you're gonna have to find another gender for yourself 'cause I'm revoking your dude membership.",Ted
2356,"Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday?",Ted
2357,"Invigorating, thanks.",Barney
2358,"Hey, Claudia!",Ted
2359,"Hey, how's it going? Claudia: My wedding's in two days, that's how it's going.",Ted
2360,"Oh, don't worry, it's gonna be great. I'm so excited.",Ted
2361,"Oh, well, yeah, I'm bringing a date, so I'll be off the market.",Ted
2362,"Uh, yes I am.",Ted
2363,I checked 'plus one'.,Ted
2364,"Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked...",Ted
2365,But I already invited someone.,Ted
2366,But I checked 'plus one'. I always check 'plus one'.,Ted
2367,"She doesn't need a place card, she knows her name.",Ted
2368,"Come on, Claudia, we go way back. Isn't there room for just one more person?",Ted
2369,"I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy.",Ted
2370,"But to be fair, she's also hot.",Barney
2371,"I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did.",Ted
2372,"Yeah, right.",Barney
2373,I did.,Ted
2374,"Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?",Barney
2375,"Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech.",Ted
2376,"Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move...",Barney
2377,"A little Barney. And you know what he said? (changing tone of voice) &quot;Ted, you will bring no dates to this wedding. You will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney.&quot;",Barney
2378,Wow.,Marshall
2379,Please stop. I gotta call Claudia. If I just explain to her...,Ted
2380,"Ted, no. Let it go. She's about to get married. She's got enough to worry about.",Marshall
2381,Then what am I gonna do?,Ted
2382,The only thing you can do. Tell Robin she can't come.,Marshall
2383,(from inside apartment) Just a second.,Robin
2384,Hey.,Lily
2385,"Hey, listen.",Ted
2386,"Wait, two things. First of all, I've been laying groundwork all afternoon, totally subtle, totally cool, not pushing, not even nudging. Just the theme of today is Ted rocks. And she's picking up on it lying down.",Lily
2387,Lily's there's a problem.,Ted
2388,"Wait, no, thing number two. The dress, we got a dress.",Lily
2389,Go.,Lily
2390,"Well, did I bring it? Or did I bring it?",Robin
2391,I think I brought it.,Robin
2392,Wow.,Ted
2393,That's what I was going for. I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're gonna have so much fun.,Robin
2394,"Yeah, about that.",Ted
2395,"So, the dress?",Lily
2396,I don't have a 'plus one' for the wedding.,Ted
2397,What?,Lily
2398,I ran into Claudia and she told me I didn't check 'plus one' on the reply card.,Ted
2399,Why didn't you check 'plus...,Lily
2400,I did check 'plus one'.,Ted
2401,But Robin is so excited.,Lily
2402,I know.,Ted
2403,And the dress.,Lily
2404,I know.,Ted
2405,"Oh. OK, OK, we'll, we'll sneak her in.",Lily
2406,"We can't sneak her in, we're not ninjas.",Ted
2407,I wish we were ninjas.,Lily
2408,I know.,Ted
2409,You can always ask Stuart.,Lily
2410,Can I do that?,Ted
2411,"Sure, you guys have been friends for a long time, and it's 40% his wedding too.",Lily
2412,"Oh, it's gonna be a tough sell.",Ted
2413,"Really? Stuart: Sure, the more the merrier.",Ted
2414,"Wow, wow, thanks for being so cool about this 'cause you know Claudia said...",Ted
2415,"Yeah, she's not usually like that.",Ted
2416,"Well, thanks, Stu, it's gonna be a great wedding.",Ted
2417,"Honey, this magazine says more and more couples are opting to have nontraditional weddings out in the woods.",Lily
2418,"Well, if a magazine says so, we should go get married in the woods like a couple of squirrels.",Marshall
2419,"Squirrels don't get married, Marshall.",Lily
2420,Like you could possibly know that.,Marshall
2421,I did it. I did it. I'm taking her to the wedding.,Ted
2422,Nice.,Lily
2423,What? How?,Marshall
2424,I talked to Stuart.,Ted
2425,"Oh, you went around the bride. &quot;Oh, this hornet's nest looks harmless. Maybe I'll poke it with a stick. Oh, look, some gremlins, let me go feed them after midnight.&quot; Did you known about this?",Marshall
2426,It may have been my idea.,Lily
2427,What? Stuart doesn't get a say.,Lily
2428,"Ha! So you admit it, the groom should have an equal say.",Marshall
2429,"Oh, yeah, sure, on the stupid stuff, like who comes.",Lily
2430,So I can invite whoever I want.,Marshall
2431,"Sure, there's plenty of room in the woods.",Lily
2432,It's Claudia.,Ted
2433,"So, it begins.",Marshall
2434,"Come on, it can't be that bad.",Ted
2435,"Here, Lily, you answer it.",Ted
2436,What? Why?,Lily
2437,Because this whole thing was your idea. And Claudia scares me.,Ted
2438,But...but you're the guy...oh.,Lily
2439,"Ted's phone. Oh, hi Claudia. What?",Lily
2440,They broke up.,Lily
2441,Ow!,Ted
2442,"(to Claudia on phone) Uh-huh, uh-huh.",Lily
2443,"It's not because of me, is it?",Ted
2444,Uh-huh.,Lily
2445,It's Robin.,Ted
2446,Answer it.,Lily
2447,"Uh, Lily's phone.",Ted
2448,Ted. Where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought.,Robin
2449,"Uh, Lily's busy.",Ted
2450,"Oh, OK, well I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's gonna love them.",Robin
2451,"That's great. I'll tell Lily to tell me. Uh, listen, I really wanna keep talking but now's not a good time so, um, I'm really excited about tomorrow. OK, bye.",Ted
2452,Bye-bye.,Robin
2453,"Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this. Do you think she's into me?",Ted
2454,"Ted, focus.",Marshall
2455,"Sweetie, just calm down. Do you wanna go somewhere and talk?",Lily
2456,"OK, meet me at MacLaren's. I'll see you there.",Lily
2457,I feel terrible.,Ted
2458,"Well, feel terrible later. Right now, we gotta fix this. Lily, you go down to the bar and comfort Claudia. Ted and I will go and try to talk some sense into Stuart.",Marshall
2459,Tell Claudia I'm sorry. Did she seem pissed at me?,Ted
2460,"She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000.",Lily
2461,Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.,Ted
2462,"Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up.",Barney
2463,"Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just... (to bartender) two vodka cranberries.",Barney
2464,"Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?",Barney
2465,(to bartender) They all drink vodka cranberries.,Barney
2466,"So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?",Barney
2467,"No, but I do have a hug.",Barney
2468,"(looking up, whispers) Thank you.",Barney
2469,"Stuart, I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...",Ted
2470,"Oh, come on, man, you don't mean that.",Marshall
2471,"Dude, who doesn't.",Marshall
2472,"That's crazy. I mean, you're the luckiest...you and Claudia both...",Ted
2473,"Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other. Everybody feels this way sometimes.",Ted
2474,"OK, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily. He's the pro. This guy knows relationships. Tell him, Marshall.",Ted
2475,"Stuart, don't get married.",Marshall
2476,Dude.,Ted
2477,"I'm sorry. Being in a couple is hard and committing, making sacrifices, it's hard. But if it's the right person, then it's easy. Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life, that should be the easiest thing in the world. And if it's not like that, then she's not the one. I'm sorry.",Marshall
2478,"You know I don't have $400,000, right?",Ted
2479,"That's just, that's... (yelling over to bartender) two more vodka cranberries please.",Barney
2480,"Claudia, it's all gonna be OK.",Barney
2481,"Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.",Barney
2482,"Oh, hell no.",Lily
2483,Oww,Barney
2484,"Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes.",Lily
2485,"Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each.",Barney
2486,"All right, all right.",Barney
2487,"So, where did we land on the whole 'plus one' thing?",Ted
2488,Still wow.,Ted
2489,Wow yourself. Look who else brought it.,Robin
2490,"Oh yeah, I thought about leaving it at home, but I figured I don't wanna get there and realize I need it and have to go all the way back to get it, so, yeah, I brought it.",Ted
2491,Sorry.,Robin
2492,"Hello. Oh my God, tonight? You're kidding. Robin: (to Ted) They want me to anchor the news tonight.",Robin
2493,"Really? Like, anchor anchor? What happened to Sandy? OK, OK, sure, what time do you need me to...Right now! Oh.",Robin
2494,Do it. Do it.,Ted
2495,"OK, I need like five minutes to change and um, I'll call you from the cab...",Robin
2496,"So, admit it, this wedding is both indoors and amazing.",Marshall
2497,I'll give you the crab puffs. The crab puffs are good.,Lily
2498,Crab puffs were incredible.,Marshall
2499,We should totally have them at our wedding.,Lily
2500,"Definitely. Hey, we just agreed on something.",Marshall
2501,Did we just start planning our wedding?,Lily
2502,I think we did.,Marshall
2503,We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce.,Lily
2504,"Oh, I thought the red sauce was like aweome.",Marshall
2505,"My God, were you born without taste buds? (Marshall smiles and laughs)",Lily
2506,What?,Lily
2507,I love you.,Marshall
2508,"Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break.",Robin
2509,"Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen.",Barney
2510,What's a sixteen?,Ted
2511,Those two eight's right over there. Yeah.,Barney
2512,Claudia.,Ted
2513,Um (clears throat) She couldn't make it.,Ted
2514,"What's so funny? Claudia: Plan a wedding, you'll see.",Ted
2515,"Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.",Ted
2516,"Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids.",Barney
2517,I didn't check 'plus one'. You were right. Barney: Of course I was right.,Ted
2518,I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single.,Ted
2519,Being single's the best.,Barney
2520,Stay out as late as you want.,Ted
2521,Answer to no one.,Barney
2522,The whole world full of endless possibilities.,Ted
2523,Never having to go to a farmer's market.,Barney
2524,"OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me...",Barney
2525,"Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, &quot;Is it?&quot; And usually they say, &quot;yes it is.&quot;",Barney
2526,"Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that.",Barney
2527,"Hey, where the hell did you disappear to last night?",Lily
2528,I had the most amazing night ever.,Ted
2529,"Tell me about it, that cake, best cake I ever had. Seriously. My stomach was like, hey bro, I don't know what you're eating 'cause I don't have any eyes but it's basically awesome so keep sending it down gullet alley.",Marshall
2530,"Yeah, I know. My stomach was like, girlfriend, we don't always get along but that cake...",Lily
2531,Say what?,Marshall
2532,Lily.,Ted
2533,"Oh right. Most amazing night ever, and go.",Lily
2534,I'm guessing you haven't always had this rule.,Ted
2535,"Exactly. Exactly, like, like just now, when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there, I'm not gonna lie to you, big time thunderbolt.",Ted
2536,Sadly not out of character. But I know now it's just a mirage.,Ted
2537,"Exactly. And that, in a nutshell, is why I'm not putting the moves on you.",Ted
2538,"What, you think this is the moves? Believe me, you'd know the moves. People ten tables away would know the moves.",Ted
2539,Tell me about it.,Ted
2540,Interested.,Ted
2541,Less interested.,Ted
2542,Go ahead.,Ted
2543,What are you saying?,Ted
2544,Unless...,Ted
2545,"Wow. OK, I'm in.",Ted
2546,"I guess, what, we'll need fake names?",Ted
2547,"Pleased to meet you, Buttercup. I'm Lando Calrissian.",Ted
2548,"Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded...",Ted
2549,"Ted, Ted, Ted, look, I got a bridesmaid, Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid, Ted, look. See ya Ted.",Barney
2550,"So, I'm Ted.",Ted
2551,No last names.,Ted
2552,Oh.,Marshall
2553,"Oh, what is wrong with you?",Lily
2554,"Dude, that is just like... a weenie ass idea.",Marshall
2555,"No, it was awesome. I had a great night, I'm never gonna see her again, and there's no way to ruin it.",Ted
2556,"Ted, how do I explain this to you? Last night I had the best cake of my life. You think I'm gonna let that cake out of my life? Hell, no. I'm gonna find out what bakery made that cake and then I'm gonna get some more cake.",Marshall
2557,"That cake really got to you, huh?",Ted
2558,It haunts me.,Marshall
2559,"So, what happened next?",Lily
2560,Mm-hm.,Ted
2561,"Yes, but we'll need a diversion.",Ted
2562,Kiss.,Ted
2563,"Go. Go, go, go",Ted
2564,"So, that's what happened to the bouquet. You know, good for Victoria. It's such an evil tradition.",Lily
2565,You're not gonna do it at your wedding?,Ted
2566,"Oh, yeah, I'm gonna take that flower grenade and chuck it into the crowd and scream, crawl for it, bitches. It's just what girls do.",Lily
2567,"So, where did you guys go?",Marshall
2568,Very nice.,Ted
2569,I couldn't really tell.,Ted
2570,"Well, it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight.",Ted
2571,No you couldn't.,Ted
2572,Totally get some.,Ted
2573,I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.,Ted
2574,OK.,Ted
2575,OK.,Ted
2576,"A drumroll? That's it. So, what, you just said good-night, came home, and performed a drum solo?",Marshall
2577,"Oh, Ted, you're such a doof. I mean, this girl sounds amazing.",Lily
2578,"She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and we connected on every level. And, I'm never gonna see her again.",Ted
2579,"Dammit, I have to see her again.",Ted
2580,"So, let's get to work, man. What else do you know about her?",Marshall
2581,"Nothing. Her name's Victoria, that's all I got. Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know.",Ted
2582,"Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon. She'll be back in two weeks. Call her then.",Lily
2583,"Yes, two weeks, good idea. I'm calling her now.",Ted
2584,"No, Ted, you don't mess with a honeymoon.",Lily
2585,"Yeah, come on, dude. Ask her about the cake.",Marshall
2586,I've moved on.,Ted
2587,"Uh, no, her name was Victoria, I don't know her last name.",Ted
2588,Thank God.,Ted
2589,There was no Victoria at the wedding.,Ted
2590,"Maybe she used a second fake name. Oh, she's good, she's very good.",Lily
2591,"Maybe she was a ghost. That's why she didn't wanna kiss you, because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second. Oh my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay.",Marshall
2592,Marshall. She was not a ghost.,Ted
2593,"I know that she wasn't a ghost, she picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form.",Marshall
2594,"Wait, wait, wait, she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids. She must have been at their table. Maybe they know who she was?",Ted
2595,Great. How do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?,Lily
2596,"This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what?",Barney
2597,Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste.,Barney
2598,"Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?",Ted
2599,You know I did.,Barney
2600,Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me.,Ted
2601,You know I won't.,Barney
2602,Why not?,Ted
2603,"Because we just hooked up last night. I can't call the girl the next day. I have to wait at least, like, forever. Oh snap. Never gonna call her. Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.",Barney
2604,"Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.",Lily
2605,"Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night.",Barney
2606,"OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.",Ted
2607,Really? Ted: Yeah.,Barney
2608,But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing.,Barney
2609,I'm ready to be proven wrong.,Ted
2610,Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial.,Barney
2611,"(on phone) Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.",Barney
2612,(to Ted) What kind of shoes...,Barney
2613,"(on phone) Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing.",Barney
2614,Actually.,Ted
2615,Oh come on.,Barney
2616,"So, what do you want to do next?",Ted
2617,Don't think...first thing that comes into your mind.,Ted
2618,Whoa. There she goes.,Ted
2619,(on phone) Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them.,Barney
2620,"Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight.",Barney
2621,I understand.,Ted
2622,"OK, let's not lose hope. We'll call the hotel, maybe she was staying there. We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria. Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...",Lily
2623,Or Ictor. Probably doesn't go by Ictor.,Marshall
2624,"No, you know what? This is fate. I am never supposed to see this girl again. That was the whole point of the night. I've just been saved from myself. Let's drink many beers.",Ted
2625,Agreed.,Marshall
2626,"Hey, there's the anchor lady! How was it?",Lily
2627,"Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor. Robin? Thanks, Robin, it was awesome. Back to you, Robin.",Robin
2628,"Congrats, that's so cool.",Lily
2629,"Yeah, I felt really bad bailing on Ted though.",Robin
2630,"Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...",Lily
2631,What?,Lily
2632,I know who she is.,Robin
2633,"You know who she is? But, you weren't even at the wedding.",Lily
2634,"Actually, I kind of was.",Robin
2635,What?,Lily
2636,"Well, after the newscast, I was so excited, I decided to surprise Ted by going to the reception.",Robin
2637,Dammit. Stop it. What the hell?,Robin
2638,"Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just allergies or something. I'm fine.",Robin
2639,"Oh, thanks, but I don't actually cry in front of people, or cry at all for that matter. Man, it's gross. Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?",Robin
2640,Because you have feelings for Ted.,Lily
2641,"I don't know, maybe.",Robin
2642,"OK, what is wrong with the two of you?! Seriously. He likes you and you like him, just, just, just be together. Geez, Louise, happiness is not that difficult.",Lily
2643,"Oh, look, OK. Yes, I cried in the bathroom, and that was weird. But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy. The fact is I don't know how I feel.",Robin
2644,Yes you do. Seeing him with someone else and crying about it. Guess what? That's how you feel. That is nothing but how you feel.,Lily
2645,"OK, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy? Lily: Kinda, yeah.",Robin
2646,But it doesn't change anything. I still don't wanna get married and he's still... Ted. What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he could be happy.,Robin
2647,Or you could tell him you're into him and then you could both be happy.,Lily
2648,I'm gonna go find him.,Robin
2649,"Well, wait. Which one are you gonna tell him?",Lily
2650,I have no idea.,Robin
2651,"And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for sex.",Barney
2652,I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.,Barney
2653,"Hi, guys,",Robin
2654,Hey.,Ted
2655,"Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?",Robin
2656,Sure. What's up?,Ted
2657,"Uh, I, I have to tell you something.",Robin
2658,Oh.,Ted
2659,"Oh, just get it.",Robin
2660,Hello.,Ted
2661,"It's fine, Claudia. Don't worry about it.",Ted
2662,"Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake.",Ted
2663,"Thanks. You're very sweet. So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?",Robin
2664,She made the cake.,Ted
2665,Buttercup Bakery. She wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest. She made the cake.,Ted
2666,"She made that cake. Ted, this is the girl. You gotta marry her, today. She has to move in with us.",Marshall
2667,I'm going down to that bakery.,Ted
2668,"No, no, don't do it.",Lily
2669,"Baby, what are you talking about?!",Marshall
2670,"Yeah, all day long, you've been busting my apple bag about finding this girl.",Ted
2671,"Well, I just think that maybe she's not that into you and that's why she didn't give you her number. Robin, care to chime in with anything? Robin: Yes. Ted. Go get her.",Lily
2672,Going. Getting.,Ted
2673,"Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up!",Barney
2674,Yes! No.,Ted
2675,Oh come on!,Barney
2676,Whoa. Guess we were gone a while.,Ted
2677,"Why yes I am. Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking.",Ted
2678,"Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.",Ted
2679,"You know, I don't look like this every day. On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.",Ted
2680,Buttercup Bakery. This is it.,Lily
2681,"Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.",Marshall
2682,"Ted, you still with us?",Barney
2683,Tell me your last name.,Ted
2684,"You know, there's one little flaw in our plan.",Ted
2685,I'm gonna go home tonight with a lot of great memories and one really sucky memory: the memory of you walking out that door.,Ted
2686,Yeah?,Ted
2687,"One, two, three, four, five.",Ted
2688,"And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be...",Ted
2689,"The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot.",Barney
2690,OK.,Ted
2691,"They have to come out soon, it's Monday.",Marshall
2692,Do you think they've been in there the whole time? I don't know whether to be proud or concerned.,Lily
2693,Maybe they're not even in there.,Marshall
2694,"Hey, guys.",Ted
2695,Thank you!,Marshall
2696,I wish you could stay.,Ted
2697,Call you afterwards?,Ted
2698,Bye.,Ted
2699,Two days straight?!,Marshall
2700,"Wow, your room must smell like a monkey cage!",Lily
2701,"Come on, give us a number. Lily guessed eight, but I know my boy got to double digits.",Marshall
2702,Zero.,Ted
2703,What?,Marshall
2704,What?,Lily
2705,"Guys, we just met. And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick, so we talked about it, and we decided to take this one slow.",Ted
2706,Her idea.,Marshall
2707,"Totally her idea! But, I don't know, I'm really into this girl, and if going slow is what it takes to make this happen, I say bring it on.",Ted
2708,I don't feel so good. t's like my testicles mixed pop rocks and soda.,Ted
2709,I can't believe she's making you wait a whole month. I would never put up with that.,Marshall
2710,You've only had sex with one girl in your whole life.,Ted
2711,Burn!,Lily
2712,"Ted, the only reason to wait a month for sex is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.",Barney
2713,Good news: I don't have to cover the cat show tomorrow night. Who's up for hanging out?,Robin
2714,"Oh, I can't, I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.",Ted
2715,"No, no, we can't, it's our nine-year anniversary.",Lily
2716,"Wow, nine years? Your relationship's a fourth grader. Congrats.",Robin
2717,Thanks. We're going to the Berkshires for the maple syrup harvest.,Lily
2718,It's one of New York Magazine's &quot;Top five romantic getaways on a budget.&quot; Who says sexual can't be sensible?,Marshall
2719,"Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me.",Robin
2720,Really?,Barney
2721,"Actually, I was talking to my martini.",Robin
2722,Ready to go?,Marshall
2723,"Hell, yeah. Nothing better than a weekend at a good bed and breakfast.",Lily
2724,Yeah. Waking up for breakfast at 7:00 A.M....Sharp.,Marshall
2725,Complimenting the odors and their collection of needle-point geese.,Lily
2726,Awkward conversations with middle-aged couples trying to stave off divorce.,Marshall
2727,"Yeah, well, we'd better get going, it's like a four-hour drive.",Lily
2728,And it's supposed to rain tonight.,Marshall
2729,Or we could just stay home.,Lily
2730,Maybe watch some TV.,Marshall
2731,Order in some Chinese.,Lily
2732,"Oh, Sichuan Garden! Are we really bailing?",Marshall
2733,"Hell, yeah.",Lily
2734,"Good, cause this thing's empty.",Marshall
2735,"Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say &quot;wow.&quot;",Barney
2736,"Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident.",Robin
2737,It's one of the many risks of the blind approach. It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot. But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.,Barney
2738,Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?,Robin
2739,You can't just... Wow!,Barney
2740,Hey? What's taking so long? I have to go.,Robin
2741,"Not so fast, Scherbotsky. I like the way you think. That mirror thing. Simple. Elegant. Okay, limited-time offer: I need a &quot;bro&quot; for my bro-ings on about town. How would you like to be said bro?",Barney
2742,"Well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped. She really needs some support... or a stranger's tongue down her throat. That seems healthy. All right. Guess I'm in.",Robin
2743,"Really? Are you sure? Wow, that snuck up on me.",Ted
2744,The 18th can't get here fast enough.,Ted
2745,"Oh. Well, um, we can just... wait until you get back. I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this.",Ted
2746,75th and Amsterdam.,Ted
2747,I'm so glad we decided to just stay home.,Lily
2748,"Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone? We'd be just getting there now, all tired and cranky.",Marshall
2749,And yet we'd feel obligated to have sex.,Lily
2750,"Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it. I would like to propose a toast. To the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever.",Marshall
2751,I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend.,Ted
2752,"Oh, my God, what are they doing home?",Lily
2753,"They think we went away. Oh, it is on for my boy, Ted.",Marshall
2754,"But we didn't go away, we're in the bathroom.",Lily
2755,They don't know that. All we have to do is hide out in here until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom.,Marshall
2756,But I don't want to hide out in here.,Lily
2757,"Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this. If we go out there and spoil the mood, it's not going to happen. Then one of us is going to have to have sex with Ted, and... not going to be me.",Marshall
2758,"Okay, fine. I guess I'll actually floss.",Lily
2759,You suited up!,Barney
2760,"Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right.",Robin
2761,Emilio? The woman will have...,Barney
2762,"I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks.",Robin
2763,"Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. &quot;The Torpedo.&quot; Or, as the rollers call it, &quot;Piramide.&quot;",Barney
2764,"My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention.",Robin
2765,Father issues. Hot.,Barney
2766,I know... I was this close to being a huge slut.,Robin
2767,"Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl.",Barney
2768,"Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have sex to get pregnant.",Robin
2769,What up! Freeze frame high five!,Barney
2770,"No. Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting. By its very nature, it... slips through our fingers... making it that much more precious.",Ted
2771,"Ugh, that is bad. That is, like, high-school-literary-magazine bad.",Lily
2772,And they're not even high.,Marshall
2773,It's actually working.,Lily
2774,"Yeah, smooth but slowly. God, close the deal, already. It's been, like, 45 minutes... we could have had sex three times by now.",Marshall
2775,"Yeah, try five.",Lily
2776,What up! Maybe we should just go out there.,Marshall
2777,No way! We can't go out there now. They'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time. It'll be too weird.,Lily
2778,Fine. But if we're stuck in here... I'm turning up the volume. Shh. Shh.,Marshall
2779,"Honey, could you hold my hair back, I think I'm going to hurl.",Lily
2780,So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?,Robin
2781,Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still...,Barney
2782,What?,Robin
2783,There is one other thing we could do. If you're up for it.,Barney
2784,"Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!",Robin
2785,"Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months.",Barney
2786,"Oh, I believe it... this is awesome!",Robin
2787,"Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you?",Barney
2788,Thank me later. Let's keep moving. These little bastards are everywhere.,Robin
2789,He's just staring into her eyes.,Marshall
2790,"I don't know, we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us.",Lily
2791,Yeah... now we just make fun of people like that. It's the circle of life.,Marshall
2792,"No, I'm serious, Marshall. I mean, we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip. And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom.",Lily
2793,"Well, it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria. This is their first time.",Marshall
2794,"Yeah, but we could still have some more romance. Now, you just say, &quot;Want to do it?&quot; And I say, &quot;Yeah.&quot;",Lily
2795,Want to...,Marshall
2796,No! Maybe we're just out of firsts.,Lily
2797,Looks like they're about to have theirs.,Marshall
2798,Should we take this to the bedroom?,Ted
2799,Yes!,Marshall
2800,Yes!,Lily
2801,Yes!,Marshall
2802,Yes!,Lily
2803,"No. No, don't answer it!",Marshall
2804,You're answering it? He's answering it!,Marshall
2805,No! Do her! Do her now!,Lily
2806,Sure. Good luck with that. <em>(He hangs up)</em> Sorry about that.,Ted
2807,I'll get another bottle.,Ted
2808,I need a drink. Do we have any cough syrup in here?,Lily
2809,Shh...,Marshall
2810,"Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it.",Robin
2811,No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does.,Barney
2812,But I...,Robin
2813,"Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky.",Barney
2814,See you on the other side.,Robin
2815,Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?,Barney
2816,Yeah.,Robin
2817,All right.,Barney
2818,"Marshall, what happened to us? We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long. Have we lost that?",Lily
2819,"Maybe. But I think I just found it. Right here. Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering with just a hint of crazy eyes.",Marshall
2820,"Okay, well, get ready for my sex-ray vision. Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning? Oh, damn it.",Lily
2821,It's all right. We can do this.,Marshall
2822,Let's just hold hands. This is nice.,Lily
2823,You love that move. It's a classic Marshall.,Marshall
2824,"All right, we totally suck at this. We really, really need to get out of here.",Lily
2825,"Well, we can't.",Marshall
2826,"Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you, it'll change the entire nature of our relationship.",Lily
2827,What is it?,Marshall
2828,I have to pee.,Lily
2829,This is bad.,Marshall
2830,Yeah.,Lily
2831,We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other. You always think there'll be more time.,Marshall
2832,"Look at us. We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet. The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it, it might go out forever.",Lily
2833,How much longer do you think you can hold it?,Marshall
2834,I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon.,Lily
2835,"Oh, boy.",Marshall
2836,Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game.,Robin
2837,Neither have I. Of course I cheat.,Barney
2838,"Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L.",Robin
2839,Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.,Barney
2840,"Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox.",Robin
2841,"Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt.",Barney
2842,That's a woman.,Robin
2843,"Oh, my mistake. Or is it?",Barney
2844,Let's just focus on your target.,Robin
2845,Right.,Barney
2846,"Yeah, I got this one. Oh, my God. I love your jeans.",Robin
2847,"Oh, no. I am all about the dudes. Although pickings are pretty slim tonight. Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get.",Robin
2848,"Well, jeans will only get you so far. I'm going home with him.",Robin
2849,"Oh, my God, I hate Ted. I hate him so much.",Lily
2850,"Baby, why don't you just go? Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other.",Marshall
2851,"No, but we haven't, because I want to keep some of the mystery alive.",Lily
2852,"Well, you have farted in front of me.",Marshall
2853,"Yes, but I always cover it with a cough.",Lily
2854,You always do.,Marshall
2855,Hey.,Barney
2856,Hey.,Robin
2857,Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.,Barney
2858,What happened?,Robin
2859,"Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release.",Barney
2860,But why?,Robin
2861,Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores.,Barney
2862,"Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship?",Robin
2863,Hit!,Barney
2864,Should we move to the bedroom?,Ted
2865,"They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour, but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom?",Marshall
2866,"Baby, I can't hold it in any longer. It's time.",Lily
2867,I know.,Marshall
2868,"I love you, Marshall.",Lily
2869,"I love you, Lily.",Marshall
2870,"Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake.",Barney
2871,"Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys.",Robin
2872,Hard-core? That's the only way I play. (<em>Barney strips down)</em>,Barney
2873,I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing?,Robin
2874,"I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me?",Barney
2875,No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends.,Robin
2876,"Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night.",Barney
2877,What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.,Robin
2878,You invited me up to your apartment to &quot;play Battleship.&quot; Is that not an internationally recognized term for sex?,Barney
2879,No.,Robin
2880,Great. I hope you're happy. You sunk my battleship.,Barney
2881,I'm okay. You okay?,Lily
2882,"I feel the same. And yet, strangely different.",Marshall
2883,"I'm happy for my bladder, yet sad for us.",Lily
2884,"You had to do it, sweetie... for Ted. And, hey, look, at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes.",Marshall
2885,"Yeah. I guess our relationship had to take a hit so a new one out there could blossom. Oh, crap!",Lily
2886,They must have heard that.,Marshall
2887,"Well, I guess we can come out now. I don't believe it. They're gone.",Lily
2888,Good. 'Cause I got to take a whiz.,Marshall
2889,"Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second...",Robin
2890,"But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well.",Barney
2891,"Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted?",Robin
2892,I checked with Ted.,Barney
2893,"Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well, I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right? I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin, you'd be cool with that, right?",Barney
2894,Sure. Good luck with that.,Ted
2895,Totally gave us his blessing.,Barney
2896,Really?,Robin
2897,Really.,Barney
2898,So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?,Robin
2899,Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh...,Barney
2900,What?,Robin
2901,You like Ted.,Barney
2902,I didn't say I liked Ted.,Robin
2903,You like Ted. Wow. This is huge.,Barney
2904,"Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for...",Robin
2905,"Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?",Barney
2906,"You're not gonna tell him, are you?",Robin
2907,No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro.,Barney
2908,A-7.,Robin
2909,Miss.,Barney
2910,Of course.,Robin
2911,"Well, we still have one frontier left. Still got the deuce.",Marshall
2912,Not making me feel better.,Lily
2913,"Well, it certainly was a first.",Marshall
2914,"It was, wasn't it? We still have firsts.",Lily
2915,"Of course we do. And you know what, I actually feel closer to you now. I want to know you. Like, know your soul.",Marshall
2916,"Marshall, what makes you cry?",Lily
2917,This moment is fleeting because it's being chased by another moment.,Marshall
2918,"Oh, just grab my boob already.",Lily
2919,"Come on, guys, get a room.",Ted
2920,You don't have to shout out &quot;poker&quot; when you win.,Ted
2921,I know. It's just fun to say.,Marshall
2922,"It's called &quot;Marsh-gammon.&quot; It combines all the best features of all the best games... Candy Land, I Never, Pictionary.",Marshall
2923,"Backgammon, obviously.",Robin
2924,"No. Backgammon sucks. I took the only good part of backgammon, the &quot;gammon,&quot; and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs.",Marshall
2925,I'm so excited Victoria's coming.,Lily
2926,I'm going to go get another round.,Robin
2927,"Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight. Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot, so don't say anything embarrass... Don't say anything. And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin, so we you could just avoid the...",Ted
2928,"Well, well, well. How rich. You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend, yet, you have been lying to her since day one. Excuse me.Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on. So, nothing for him to stand on? Okay, and thanks so much. Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin? I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return.",Barney
2929,No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that.,Ted
2930,"Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return?",Lily
2931,"Nothing. It's nothing. And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria?",Ted
2932,Us? What would we do?,Lily
2933,"Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have and, in fact, moved here to get away from. However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight?",Ted
2934,Fine.,Marshall
2935,Fine.,Lily
2936,Thank you.,Ted
2937,I should go help Robin.,Lily
2938,Hey.,Robin
2939,"Hey. So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight?",Lily
2940,"Oh, sure. She's great. Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted? No. Victoria's great. She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great. I said, &quot;She's great&quot; too many times, didn't I?",Robin
2941,You must really hate the bitch.,Lily
2942,"But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest, then you &quot;Marshall out,&quot; and all your chips go into the pot, and remember, if you ever ask the question &quot;What?&quot;, then... you got to drink. Got it?",Marshall
2943,"Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just start, you guys'll pick it up. Newbie goes first. Roll.",Marshall
2944,"Three! You got Autobiography. Now, that's where you have to answer a personal question about your dating life truthfully in order to move on.",Marshall
2945,"Marshall, come on.",Ted
2946,"Hey, she's the one who rolled a three. Victoria, &quot;Have you ever cheated while in a relationship?&quot; Wow, good question.",Marshall
2947,You don't have to answer that.,Ted
2948,"Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer. You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains.",Marshall
2949,"So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?",Barney
2950,"You said what, you got to drink!",Marshall
2951,"Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd, and the host said she knew you. What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?",Lily
2952,"Shannon?! Shannon, Shannon... No, don't remember any Shannon.",Barney
2953,"Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give...",Lily
2954,Where's the tape?,Barney
2955,Fine. I'll go get it.,Lily
2956,"Cool, okay. You know, whenever.",Barney
2957,"Okay, Robin, your roll. Five! Another Autobiography... for the player to your left, which... Victoria!",Marshall
2958,Of course.,Ted
2959,"Victoria, &quot;How many boyfriends did you have before you started dating Ted?&quot;",Marshall
2960,"Wait, the card actually says &quot;Ted?&quot;",Ted
2961,Prude alert.,Robin
2962,"Oh, slut alert!",Robin
2963,"Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach. Oh, wow, look at that. Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me.",Barney
2964,Thank you! Finally somebody understands Marsh-gammon.,Marshall
2965,"Barney, what was on that tape?",Lily
2966,Too bad you'll never find out.,Barney
2967,"Oh, damn it! If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse. Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did.",Lily
2968,What?!,Barney
2969,Drink!,Marshall
2970,"Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead. So, should we pop it in?",Lily
2971,"Give it to me, give it, give me...",Barney
2972,"Play the tape, play it, play it!",Ted
2973,"Ted! Fine, fine. You cannot play it. Shannon! I love you! I love you so much. What about us changing the world together? Don't tell me you've forgotten. I know I haven't. Will I ever see another rainbow? Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe? Baby, please Don't go There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love There's a thief in the palace and she's...",Barney
2974,Did you try his cell phone?,Marshall
2975,"Yeah, I left two messages. I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard. He's off the grid.",Ted
2976,"Hey, guys, what up?",Barney
2977,"Barney, where have you been?",Robin
2978,"Yeah, we're-we're really sorry about that.",Ted
2979,"Yeah, so sorry. But seriously, what was up with the tape? No, no, stay.",Lily
2980,"I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it. It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me.",Barney
2981,"Well, we all have embarrassing stories. Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it.",Marshall
2982,"Oh, really? Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall? Show me how good it is.",Barney
2983,All right.,Marshall
2984,"I was stopping by Lily's kindergarten class to say hi, but they were all at recess. I really had to pee, so I went into the class's restroom. It was a-a smaller target than I'm used to, so I figured I should sit down. What I didn't realize was, it was a shared bathroom. I wish I'd pulled up my pants.",Marshall
2985,The kids still call him Funny Butt.,Lily
2986,"Okay. I'll tell you my story. Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today.",Barney
2987,"It was 1998. I was just out of college, and I was working at a coffeehouse with my girlfriend. My girlfriend... *Shannon. Yeah, you were meant for me And I was meant for you. Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.* Thank you. All right.",Barney
2988,"And I love you, Shannon.",Barney
2989,I know. Only five short weeks till we're down in Nicaragua.,Barney
2990,"Mellow order, bro, mellow order.",Barney
2991,"Sorry, I only give high twos.",Barney
2992,"Listen to you. That? You know, women aren't objects. They're human beings. And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we're married. You can read about it in my zine.",Barney
2993,"I feel sorry for you, man.",Barney
2994,"Suits. Five weeks later, we were all set to leave for the Peace Corps. Only problem was... she never showed up.",Barney
2995,She never showed?,Robin
2996,"So, what happened next?",Ted
2997,You know what? This was a mistake.,Barney
2998,Wait... What if somebody else told their most humiliating story?,Lily
2999,"Oh, I know just how to decide who.",Marshall
3000,You brought the game to the bar?,Lily
3001,"Well, we're not quitting just 'cause Ted's so far ahead.",Marshall
3002,I was winning?,Ted
3003,Fine. I'll go next.,Robin
3004,I was doing a report on live TV about a hansom cab driver.,Robin
3005,Not the slipping-in-horse-poop story!,Barney
3006,"Yeah, we all know that one.",Ted
3007,"Yeah, Victoria, way to step up!",Marshall
3008,That is the greatest story ever!,Marshall
3009,Oh my God!,Lily
3010,"Wow, wow!",Ted
3011,"Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy. My saga... continues.",Barney
3012,I went back to the coffeehouse to find Shannon.,Barney
3013,"Sugar Bear, where were you?",Barney
3014,But the Nicaraguans need us!,Barney
3015,"Shannon, there is no...",Barney
3016,"As I walked away, I realized Shannon was an adult. Her father couldn't control her life. I had to go back and confront him. She was in the middle of a heated argument with her dad.",Barney
3017,Now we all got to drink.,Marshall
3018,"Oh, my God. What happened next?",Ted
3019,"I don't know, guys.",Barney
3020,"Okay, okay. Marshall's mom sent us cookies...",Lily
3021,"Lily, no!",Marshall
3022,"For the team, Marshall, for the team.",Lily
3023,"Hey, Mrs. Eriksen, it's Lily. Thank you so much for the delicious cookies. Mayonnaise. Really? Never would have guessed. Well, I will definitely give Marshall a kiss for you. Okay. Take care.",Lily
3024,"Oh, crap. My mom sent cookies?",Marshall
3025,"Yeah. I wish we had a dog, so they wouldn't go to waste.",Lily
3026,So we've got the whole place to ourselves.,Marshall
3027,I'm thinking floor sex.,Lily
3028,Sounds reasonable.,Marshall
3029,"Ooh, floor's cold. Grab that afghan your mom made.",Lily
3030,The whole time?,Robin
3031,The... whole... time.,Lily
3032,"Barney, that was really embarrassing for both of us. We just earned a huge chunk of story.",Marshall
3033,"Right. So where was I? Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad.",Barney
3034,"How can... With your dad? I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!",Barney
3035,We're breaking up? But what about the Peace Corps?,Barney
3036,But I love you.,Barney
3037,"I didn't go. That night, I recorded my video and mailed it to Shannon. I didn't see her until a week later. There's sugar in the basket. Shannon! Shannon, you came back!",Barney
3038,Oh. Did you... did you get my tape?,Barney
3039,You? It was you?,Barney
3040,"Oh, you poor thing.",Lily
3041,The story's not over. I did see Shannon one more time.,Barney
3042,When?,Robin
3043,Sorry.,Marshall
3044,You've got to tell us.,Lily
3045,"I don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it.",Barney
3046,Fine. Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...,Ted
3047,"Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear. Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth. Why can't you?",Barney
3048,"You're right. Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet, but a while back, I was kind of into Robin. In fact, on our first date, I might have said, &quot;I love you.&quot; Understandably, she freaked out and I left. But unfortunately, the night did not end there.",Ted
3049,We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit.,Ted
3050,"And I drank... a lot. So you guys think I should have kissed her? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now.",Ted
3051,Yes! Do it!,Barney
3052,Hello? Is someone out there?,Robin
3053,You ralphed and ran?,Lily
3054,I thought you were vomit-free since '93. So that was a lie?,Marshall
3055,You re-returned for me. That's really sweet. Though you kind of ruined my customized Scherbotsky doormat.,Robin
3056,Sorry.,Ted
3057,It's okay.,Robin
3058,"Victoria, I know this must be...",Ted
3059,"Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story. But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine. We fast-forward eight years into the future.",Barney
3060,"Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year.",Marshall
3061,"Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight.",Barney
3062,Hi.,Barney
3063,"Hi, Shannon.",Barney
3064,"Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life.",Barney
3065,"She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker: Shannon's a mom. She has a little kid named Max. That's crazy. That could have been my kid. But instead, what do I have? My whole life's some money in the bank, some suits in my closet and a string of one-night stands.",Barney
3066,"Hey. Come on. I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another, it doesn't make your life any worse.",Lily
3067,"My life rocks! Money, suits and sex. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a b*llet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.",Barney
3068,Nope.,Lily
3069,Yeah.,Barney
3070,Nope.,Lily
3071,Yeah.,Barney
3072,"Sorry. Don't buy it. You're making it up. You're just trying to cover the fact that you actually had a profound moment of doubt about yourself and... Oh, my God.",Lily
3073,"Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?",Barney
3074,"Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down.",Barney
3075,"Ew, gross. Just stop it.",Lily
3076,"Ladies, gentlemen... Ted. This has been a wonderful evening. I got great dirt on all you guys. I got Ted to tell the re-return. I finally nailed Shannon! Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right. And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is. Peace out, hombres!",Barney
3077,I think Barney just won game night.,Marshall
3078,My first solo batch.,Ted
3079,"Um, are you coloring in your butt?",Barney
3080,"I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.",Marshall
3081,So wear another one.,Barney
3082,I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.,Marshall
3083,"Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door.",Barney
3084,"Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world.",Marshall
3085,"Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.",Barney
3086,"A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding.",Marshall
3087,"Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks &quot;suit.&quot; Tomorrow, noon, my tailor.",Barney
3088,"No thanks, dude. <em>(Barney grabs Marshall's pants and tears them apart)</em> Noon?",Marshall
3089,Noon. See you then.,Barney
3090,"Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask.",Robin
3091,Robin!,Lily
3092,"Oh, come on. We bust on each other. We're just at that place in our strong friendship.",Robin
3093,"Get off me. Oh, see? I did it again.",Robin
3094,Really? That'd be great.,Lily
3095,"Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster?",Robin
3096,"Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them?",Lily
3097,The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.,Robin
3098,"Sold. Victoria, what's wrong?",Lily
3099,"Wait. Germany, Europe?",Ted
3100,"So, this is the Europe Germany?",Ted
3101,The one in Epcot?,Ted
3102,Sorry. Congratulations.,Ted
3103,"Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?",Ted
3104,"Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.",Ted
3105,"Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel...",Ted
3106,"Monday, September the...?",Ted
3107,Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want. We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.,Ted
3108,"Hey, baby, how's the dress place?",Marshall
3109,Everything's so fluffy and white. It's like shopping in a marshmallow. How's Barney's tailor?,Lily
3110,"Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.",Marshall
3111,"Well, good luck, baby.",Lily
3112,"Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?",Marshall
3113,"Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process.",Barney
3114,You speak Ukrainian?,Marshall
3115,"Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option.",Ted
3116,"No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no sex. k*ll me now.",Marshall
3117,Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.,Barney
3118,Really? You?,Ted
3119,"Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from k*ll.",Barney
3120,"Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?",Marshall
3121,Yeah.,Ted
3122,"Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, &quot;You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face.&quot; Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am.",Marshall
3123,"Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point?",Ted
3124,"Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost k*ll us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay.",Marshall
3125,"Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.",Ted
3126,"Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.",Marshall
3127,"Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.",Ted
3128,Are you sure?,Barney
3129,All right. (<em>He calls Victoria)</em>,Ted
3130,"Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?",Ted
3131,"Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye. <em>(He hungs up)</em> She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all.",Ted
3132,"Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.",Barney
3133,"Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?",Marshall
3134,Here. Play with this pin cushion.,Barney
3135,God. I'm going to look hot.,Marshall
3136,"Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.",Barney
3137,No way. The Kid does not sell out.,Marshall
3138,"Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.",Barney
3139,No. I've made my decision.,Marshall
3140,"So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go.",Ted
3141,I want you to stay.,Ted
3142,Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.,Marshall
3143,"Oh, good luck, baby.",Lily
3144,Bye.,Marshall
3145,Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.,Lily
3146,I saw a couple up front that were nice.,Robin
3147,Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.,Lily
3148,Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!,Lily
3149,And cake.,Robin
3150,"Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?",Robin
3151,Ugh. All talking and no sex. k*ll me now.,Lily
3152,"Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months.",Robin
3153,"Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.",Robin
3154,"Sex. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This bastard's kicked.",Robin
3155,"It's okay, guys, I hate it.",Lily
3156,"It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses.",Robin
3157,"You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.",Lily
3158,"Hey, random question: how do you feel cats?",Ted
3159,A cat person. Why am I not surprised?,Robin
3160,Maybe he's going to buy you one.,Lily
3161,Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.,Robin
3162,"Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany.",Robin
3163,"Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.",Lily
3164,"Ugly, ugly, ugly.",Robin
3165,Are you okay?,Lily
3166,I'm fine.,Robin
3167,Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.,Lily
3168,"I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship.",Robin
3169,"Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.",Lily
3170,"Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.",Lily
3171,I know what you mean.,Robin
3172,"Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.",Lily
3173,Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.,Robin
3174,"Oh, no way... you're the coolest.",Robin
3175,"Okay, I am.",Robin
3176,"Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.",Lily
3177,"Wow, you look incredible.",Robin
3178,"Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?",Lily
3179,"Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.",Robin
3180,"Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married. <em>(She sits on the cake, without noticing it)</em> Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?",Lily
3181,"Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake.",Robin
3182,"Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.",Robin
3183,It was like this when I found it?,Lily
3184,Credit card... s.,Lily
3185,I want you to stay.,Ted
3186,You're going?,Ted
3187,So that's what you decided?,Ted
3188,"What is this, opposite day or something?",Ted
3189,So it is?,Ted
3190,"I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are.",Ted
3191,"Well, that's just crazy.",Ted
3192,But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.,Ted
3193,"We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this.",Ted
3194,I guess so. I guess so.,Ted
3195,"God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.",Marshall
3196,"It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.",Ted
3197,"Well, thank you for acknowledging it. It was weird that you hadn't. Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?",Marshall
3198,She's leaving tomorrow.,Ted
3199,"Yeah, but she's still in town.",Marshall
3200,"Yeah, she... she's still in town.",Ted
3201,"Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together. Ted, think about it this way: if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow, would you sit on the couch and cry about it, or would you run, and jump, and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?",Marshall
3202,"Awesome air kicks, huh?",Ted
3203,New pajama bottoms?,Marshall
3204,You know it.,Ted
3205,"So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.",Ted
3206,"No, the leg is a metaphor.",Ted
3207,"Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?",Ted
3208,Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.,Ted
3209,"Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.",Ted
3210,Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?,Ted
3211,"Yeah, big day.",Ted
3212,"Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune.",Robin
3213,"No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.",Lily
3214,"Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.",Robin
3215,"Yeah, but only, like, second base.",Lily
3216,"Look at us: two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash.",Barney
3217,"Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.",Marshall
3218,"So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?",Barney
3219,"Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp.",Marshall
3220,"Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.",Barney
3221,"B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price.",Marshall
3222,"Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.",Barney
3223,You set this up! You set this whole thing up!,Marshall
3224,I most certainly did...,Barney
3225,"Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise.",Marshall
3226,"I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.",Lily
3227,What time is the interview?,Marshall
3228,"9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes. Don't worry, I know a guy.",Barney
3229,"Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the sex.",Ted
3230,"I'm going to miss you, too.",Ted
3231,Even if we're not.,Ted
3232,"Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?",Ted
3233,We can b*at the odds.,Ted
3234,It's gonna work. We're going to make it work-- it'll work.,Ted
3235,What advice do you have for a budding anthropologist?,Marshall
3236,"Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live with the gorillas, just like you did.",Marshall
3237,"...and if economic sanctions and trade restrictions aren't enforced, the destruction of the rainforests will continue and over a million species will be wiped out.",Marshall
3238,So you don't want coffee.,Ted
3239,I'm saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible...,Marshall
3240,All right. I'm pouring it out.,Ted
3241,"Okay, one cup. The kid needs to be alert. First day on the job and everything.",Marshall
3242,I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us. &quot;The kid&quot; has become &quot;the man.&quot;,Ted
3243,"Okay, it's just an internship to make a little money. After law school, I'm going to work for the NRDC. They're gonna stop global warming.",Marshall
3244,Here's your sack lunch.,Lily
3245,"Okay, I love you because, one, you made me a sack lunch and two, you laugh every time you say the word &quot;sack&quot;.",Marshall
3246,"I love you, Marshmallow.",Lily
3247,I love you.,Marshall
3248,"I love you too, Marshmallow.",Ted
3249,Uh-oh. Ted?,Marshall
3250,"Oh, no. No, she didn't.",Ted
3251,"Yeah. Yeah, she did.",Marshall
3252,Another care package?,Ted
3253,How many is that so far?,Marshall
3254,Three.,Ted
3255,And how many have you sent her?,Lily
3256,"In the mail or in my mind? Zero. She's up three-zip. Oh! Cupcakes! Great. I bet they're delicious, too. Yup, they're delicious. Damn it! I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes. God, I hate myself right now.",Ted
3257,"God, that is so me at 15.",Marshall
3258,Go for Barney.,Barney
3259,A sasquatch?,Barney
3260,Yes! Look at you. You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.,Barney
3261,Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters.,Marshall
3262,"Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all: Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness...",Barney
3263,There's one for awesomeness?,Marshall
3264,"Yeah, I had it made. Sit.",Barney
3265,"Hey, so, now that I'm working here, are you finally going to tell me exactly what your job is?",Marshall
3266,Please.,Barney
3267,"Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall. These guys are in legal. You're gonna be working with them.",Barney
3268,Marshall Eriksen. Nice to meet you.,Marshall
3269,"Where, I don't, I don't see...",Marshall
3270,Marshall? Sidebar. Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.,Barney
3271,I don't have a back door.,Marshall
3272,"Right. Well, uh... I'm engaged, so--",Marshall
3273,"We're still engaged, even if she's...",Marshall
3274,Sure you don't want one?,Ted
3275,How many of those have you eaten?,Robin
3276,"Four. Teen. No, just four. And the icing from two more. So, anyway, here's the problem.",Ted
3277,"Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep. Anyway, I got the care package, and it's just great. Here, listen... Mmm. Mmm!",Ted
3278,"So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake... And... I said something dumb.",Ted
3279,"Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail. I sent it a couple days ago. And it's awesome. Really, really awesome.",Ted
3280,Why did I say that? I think frosting makes me lie.,Ted
3281,"Oh, Teddy boy.",Robin
3282,"Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her. So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake.",Ted
3283,"All right, here's what you do: Put together a care package of stuff from New York-- some H&amp;H bagels, an Empire State Building keychain... and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready? From three days ago.",Robin
3284,"That's brilliant. You're brilliant. You know, it's funny, not so long ago, I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you.",Ted
3285,That is funny.,Robin
3286,"Okay, fine, I have feelings for him.",Robin
3287,"Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like.",Ted
3288,"The irony is clear, Ted.",Robin
3289,Hey! How was your first day?,Lily
3290,I don't wanna talk about it. The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks.,Marshall
3291,What?,Lily
3292,They're jerks!,Marshall
3293,What makes them jerks?,Lily
3294,"Forget it, I don't want to talk about it. Well, like today at lunch..",Marshall
3295,"For your information, my fiancee did.",Marshall
3296,No.,Marshall
3297,Nothing. Give it.,Marshall
3298,Give it.,Marshall
3299,"Give it back. Hey, give it. Gimme... Give it!",Marshall
3300,"Oh, screw those guys! We're adorable.",Lily
3301,"I know. God. It's like freshman year all over again. Only this time, my sweet dance moves aren't going to be enough to win them over. Not even Old Reliable.",Marshall
3302,"Sweetie... It would be cool to have some extra money, but, but, if you're unhappy, it's not worth it.",Lily
3303,I quit.,Marshall
3304,"What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great.",Barney
3305,"We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do?",Marshall
3306,Please.,Barney
3307,"I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me.",Marshall
3308,"Oh, of course it's not for you. It's for Lily.",Barney
3309,What?,Marshall
3310,Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?,Barney
3311,The package?,Marshall
3312,The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while.,Barney
3313,Lily doesn't care about that stuff.,Marshall
3314,"Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.",Barney
3315,She'll be happy.,Marshall
3316,Okay. But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier.,Barney
3317,"I guess, uh... Bea Arthur.",Marshall
3318,"So, did she get the awesome care package yet?",Robin
3319,Yep. Yesterday.,Ted
3320,Did she love it?,Robin
3321,"Ooh, she loved it.",Ted
3322,So what's the problem?,Robin
3323,"So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you, we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half. Eventually you just run out of stuff to say.",Ted
3324,What did you have for lunch today? Oh. Rye bread. Yeah.,Ted
3325,"Oh, Teddy boy.",Robin
3326,"I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch. Maybe it just can't be do. I think it's clear what I have to do.",Ted
3327,It's pretty clear.,Robin
3328,I have to go to Germany and surprise her.,Ted
3329,"Totally what I was thinking. Get out of my head, man!",Robin
3330,"Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?",Marshall
3331,"Marshall, consider the penguins.",Barney
3332,The penguins?,Marshall
3333,On the wall.,Barney
3334,&quot;Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold.&quot; This is a motivational poster?,Marshall
3335,"Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy. And you know why? Because you're different. Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are, or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier.",Barney
3336,"Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational.",Lily
3337,"Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled, but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas. I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them. It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool?",Marshall
3338,It sounds kinda like peer pressure.,Lily
3339,"No, no, no. It's totally anthropological and it's cool and I'm doing it.",Marshall
3340,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure. We have an assembly every year.",Lily
3341,I'm portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure.,Marshall
3342,"All right, but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke, what do you say?",Lily
3343,Only when I'm drunk.,Marshall
3344,Good boy.,Lily
3345,"Okay, I'm psyched about this. But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too.",Barney
3346,"Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched.",Marshall
3347,"Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it. Show it.",Barney
3348,I'm psyched!,Marshall
3349,"What was that? Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure. That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",Barney
3350,"Wow, that was really specific.",Marshall
3351,Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt!,Barney
3352,So badly.,Marshall
3353,And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done.,Barney
3354,Right. Get what done?,Marshall
3355,Whatever.,Barney
3356,Cool. And what guy is this?,Marshall
3357,There's always a guy.,Barney
3358,"Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready.",Marshall
3359,You sure? You want to practice your story one more time?,Barney
3360,"All right. So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa, and they're all, &quot;Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs.&quot; So I'm, like, &quot;Snapadoo!&quot; So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport......and that is when the bouncer kicked us out. Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, but dudes, fake diamond ring? Worth every penny, bruh.",Marshall
3361,Uh-oh.,Ted
3362,"So she's going to dump me. Has anyone ever said, &quot;Listen, I've been thinking,&quot; and then follow it up with something good? It's not like: Listen, I've been thinking, Nutter-Butters are an underrated cookie. What else can it be? What could she possibly have to say to me that she couldn't write in an e-mail?",Ted
3363,"I cut off all my fingers? Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it. I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident. I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you.",Robin
3364,"Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy. So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?",Ted
3365,I'd wait.,Robin
3366,"'Sup, Blauman? b*mb here. We still on for karaoke? Dope. I'm going to rock you on the mike so hard your hears are going to bleed gravy. Catch you on the flip, butt puppet.",Marshall
3367,Okay...what do you think?,Lily
3368,Steak sauce.,Marshall
3369,Steak sauce?,Lily
3370,Yeah.,Marshall
3371,"Look, you know, whatever anthropology you do at work is your business, but please don't act like that around here.",Lily
3372,"Lily, when Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-...",Marshall
3373,"No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline came home from the gorillas, she didn't run around picking nits out of people's hair and-and throwing feces. I'm begging you just, just leave it at the office.",Lily
3374,Why?,Marshall
3375,"Because you're acting like one of those guys, and those guys are lame.",Lily
3376,"Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes, but they're actually good guys, and if you got to know them, then you would see that. Come karaoke with us tonight, and you'll see how totally not that lame they are, okay?",Marshall
3377,Okay.,Lily
3378,You're right. They're delightful.,Lily
3379,"So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?",Marshall
3380,Nah. I'm so over karaoke.,Barney
3381,Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.,Marshall
3382,"Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really. But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.",Barney
3383,"Oh, baby, they have our song. Let's do &quot;Don't Go Breaking My Heart.&quot;",Lily
3384,"&quot;Don't Go Breaking My Heart.&quot; Elton John, Kiki Dee.",Marshall
3385,"Well, actually, Marshall and I have this little dance routine.",Lily
3386,&quot;Iron Man.&quot; I could do &quot;Iron Man.&quot;,Marshall
3387,"Okay, that was gross. When were you going to tell me you changed your entire career path?",Lily
3388,"Nothing has changed, okay? I still want to help the environment. I just thought that maybe I could make some money for a few years. We could buy an apartment, send our kids to good schools. You could quit your job and focus on your painting. I know that you say you don't need it, but... I love you and I want to give it to you anyway. I want to give you the package.",Marshall
3389,"The package?! You've already given me the package. You've got a great package, Marshall. I love your package.",Lily
3390,"Lily, you're the most incredible woman I know, and you deserve a big package.",Marshall
3391,"Your package has always been big enough. You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen, but you've got a huge package.",Lily
3392,Hello.,Robin
3393,Why hasn't she called yet?,Ted
3394,"Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.",Robin
3395,"No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.",Ted
3396,"I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome.",Robin
3397,"Thanks. Anyway, it's almost 11:00. I should let you go. Break a leg.",Ted
3398,I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring.,Ted
3399,Marshall.,Ted
3400,"Hey, hey.",Marshall
3401,"Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you in a month.",Ted
3402,Yeah. Yeah. How you doing?,Marshall
3403,I think Victoria's about to break up with me.,Ted
3404,"Oh, God, I'm sorry, man.",Marshall
3405,"Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like. The more I try to picture her, the more I can't. Like, I remember how she makes me feel. I just... I don't completely remember her. It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone.",Ted
3406,Preserving something that's already gone. Sounds like environmental law.,Marshall
3407,"I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car?",Ted
3408,*Don't go breakin' my heart*,Marshall
3409,*I couldn't if I tried*,Lily
3410,"*Honey, if I get restless*",Marshall
3411,"*Baby, you're not that kind...*",Lily
3412,Hello.,Ted
3413,"Hi, Ted. It's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but, uh, do you want to come over?",Robin
3414,She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and...,Ted
3415,You have feelings for Ted.,Lily
3416,Maybe.,Robin
3417,Do you want to try long distance?,Ted
3418,"&quot;This long-distance thing sucks, huh? And I really need to talk to you tonight.&quot;",Robin
3419,She's going to dump me!,Ted
3420,"She's not going to break up with you, Ted.",Robin
3421,Hello?,Ted
3422,Do you want to come over?,Robin
3423,Hello.,Ted
3424,"Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over?",Robin
3425,"Sit. Good boys. Okay, remember, stay out of the liquor cabinet. I'll see you tonight.",Robin
3426,"And so the life of a television reporter is very rewarding, and I stronly urge you to consider it as a career. Thank you. Yeah?",Robin
3427,Marshall was here yesterday. They just learned the word &quot;fiancÃ©.&quot;,Lily
3428,"Oh, no, I don't have a fiancÃ©.",Robin
3429,"Well, actually, I've got five dogs.",Robin
3430,"No, I've got five dogs.",Robin
3431,"Well, yeah, that's cats. I'm not some pathetic cat lady. Not that your grandmother is...",Robin
3432,Does anyone else have a...? Yes?,Robin
3433,No. Are you? Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les...,Robin
3434,"Okay, let's have a big hand for Robin the reporter. All right, our next guest is another friend...",Lily
3435,"So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks? 'Cause I just saw one. What up? Tiny five.",Barney
3436,"Ha-ha. Laugh now, those kids are monsters. They're going to eat you alive.",Robin
3437,He has a job doing... What do you do?,Lily
3438,"Please. Kids, let's rap. You guys don't give half a brown Crayola what I do for a living, do you?",Barney
3439,No. I know what you want. Magic.,Barney
3440,Hello.,Robin
3441,Why hasn't she called yet?,Ted
3442,"Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.",Robin
3443,"What's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.",Ted
3444,I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.,Robin
3445,"No, and why does this keep coming up today?",Robin
3446,"What? Oh, no, that was Ted. He's just a friend. I mean, there was this moment where we almost dated, but we want completely different things. Anyway, now he has this girlfriend in Germany and he thinks she's calling to dump him tonight, but I don't think she is. And besides, we want completely different things.",Robin
3447,What?,Robin
3448,"Well, moving past the horrifying image of your hair helmet clanging against the headboard, don't get involved with people I work with.",Robin
3449,"Hey, guys. Miss me? I missed you, too. Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over? Ted?",Robin
3450,"Uh, yeah... Uh, hi, I'm here.",Ted
3451,Do you want to come over?,Robin
3452,Why? What's up?,Ted
3453,"Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like, &quot;You know who likes juice? Ted.&quot;",Robin
3454,I love juice.,Ted
3455,Great. So you want to come over and make juice?,Robin
3456,"Okay, sure. I'll come over. We'll... juice.",Ted
3457,"Yes, we'll juice.",Robin
3458,Okay.,Ted
3459,Okay... bye.,Robin
3460,Bye.,Ted
3461,This is fine. This is totally fine.,Ted
3462,"Oh, I'm, uh, going over to this girl's house to make some juice.",Ted
3463,"No, it's not like that. We're juicing as friends. See, I have this girlfriend, I would never cheat on her. She lives in Germany. See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk. I still haven't heard from her. I don't know. Sorry to bug you with my problems. Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh?",Ted
3464,You can just let me out right up here.,Ted
3465,"Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth. Okay, here's where I left off with the last guy. See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over to this other girl's house...",Ted
3466,"Okay, relax, Robin's just a friend.",Ted
3467,"Yes, yes! Juice is perfectly harmless. In fact, it's healthy.",Ted
3468,"I am not won... Okay, even if I am wondering that, it's only 'cause you put it in my head.",Ted
3469,Damn it! Nothing's going to happen.,Ted
3470,"Okay, okay. You want a second opinion? Fine.",Ted
3471,"Hey, did she call?",Marshall
3472,"No. I need a ruling. Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but I'm on my way over to Robin's right now. She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out.",Ted
3473,"Let me call you back. Honey, there's a situation developing. Do you remember the huge secret that you told me that you weren't supposed to but you did? The thing... about Robin?",Marshall
3474,"Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted?",Barney
3475,"Yeah, she told me already. Go on.",Barney
3476,Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell? She told you and not me?,Marshall
3477,"Well, I guess I'm just better friends with her than you are.",Barney
3478,"Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are.",Marshall
3479,That is a lie!,Barney
3480,It is not a lie.,Marshall
3481,"Okay, that's it! You and me! I'm not afraid of you!",Barney
3482,I'll show you things you never seen before! I used to box in the Army!,Marshall
3483,"Come on, pick up. Damn it, Victoria, where are you? Pick up, pick up!",Ted
3484,"No, thanks. Where are you? Why haven't you called?",Ted
3485,Yeah. Why do I doubt that? Hello.,Ted
3486,"Ted, I just saw the news and a truck carrying sulphuric acid overturned right in front of Robin's house. And it's melting through the sidewalk. You can see straight down into hell. It's bad. You should go home, dude.",Marshall
3487,"Marshall, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen.",Ted
3488,"Ted, what does your mom always say?",Marshall
3489,Nothing good ever...,Ted
3490,Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m. Go home! It's too late for juice.,Marshall
3491,"Dude, Robin and I are just friends. She doesn't even like me that way.",Ted
3492,"Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.",Lily
3493,What?,Ted
3494,"It's a big secret, so don't tell her I told you, but she's very vulnerable right now and you have a girlfriend. Go home, Ted.",Lily
3495,She-she likes me?,Ted
3496,"Yes. So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there. Go home, Ted.",Lily
3497,She likes me?,Ted
3498,"Go home, Ted.",Lily
3499,"Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home.",Ted
3500,Good. He's going home.,Lily
3501,He is so not going home. I cannot believe you just told him that.,Marshall
3502,What do you mean?,Lily
3503,"Lily, here's what you just said: &quot;Ted, whatever you do, don't go up there. There's a beautiful girl who wants to have sex with you. And then she's gonna make you some delicious juice.&quot;",Marshall
3504,"No, he's not going up there. He has more sense than that.",Lily
3505,Keep the change.,Ted
3506,You want to get out of the way?,Ted
3507,"You know, if you had just called me, I...",Ted
3508,Hi.,Robin
3509,"Hi. Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets.",Ted
3510,Or we could just drink wine.,Robin
3511,"Wine... not? Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said.",Ted
3512,Thanks.,Robin
3513,Make it a big glass.,Ted
3514,Sure.,Robin
3515,"So, how's it hanging?",Ted
3516,Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore or what the hell you're doing with your life? Do you ever have one of those days?,Robin
3517,"Uh, about once a week.",Ted
3518,"I don't know, it was just a, a rough day and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you. So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?",Robin
3519,We broke up.,Ted
3520,What?,Robin
3521,"Yeah. Yeah, she finally called. We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is-- and then... she dumped me.",Ted
3522,"Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful.",Robin
3523,You're smiling.,Ted
3524,"Am I? No I'm not. I'm a news anchor. Smiling's a part of the job. Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today. See? You're smiling, too.",Robin
3525,Yeah. I have no idea what that's all about.,Ted
3526,How much does Korean Elvis rock? I'll answer that. Infinity. He rocks... infinity.,Marshall
3527,"Okay, it's time for bed.",Lily
3528,What? No. It's 2:30.,Barney
3529,Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.,Lily
3530,"You know, I have found, in my travels... that all the best things in life happen after 2:00 a.m. When I look back at the best stories of my life-- the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy, the almost four-way.",Barney
3531,You never had a four-way.,Marshall
3532,"I said &quot;almost.&quot; All those things happened after 2:00 a.m. because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary.",Barney
3533,We're going home.,Lily
3534,"What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?",Barney
3535,And it begins.,Barney
3536,"So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look.",Ted
3537,"Oh, yeah. Do you like it?",Robin
3538,"Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right.",Ted
3539,Wow. Weird.,Robin
3540,"Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this.",Ted
3541,I'll be here.,Robin
3542,Hello?,Ted
3543,Sorry about that.,Marshall
3544,Was that Korean Elvis?,Ted
3545,"I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's.",Marshall
3546,"Um... Actually... I'm at Robin's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.",Ted
3547,"Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis, but what the bleep are you doing, dude?",Marshall
3548,"What do you expect from me? It's Robin. Victoria's great, but, it's Robin. I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria.",Ted
3549,Gonna?,Lily
3550,Yes. First thing tomorrow.,Ted
3551,"Okay, but, but, as of right now at-at... 2:45 a.m. you still have a girlfriend. Ted, I love you. I love Robin. But if you do this right now, your entire future with her will be built on a crime. Just go home, Ted. Don't do this the wrong way.",Lily
3552,I hate how you're always right.,Ted
3553,It's my best and most annoying trait.,Lily
3554,Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.,Ted
3555,Hey.,Robin
3556,I should probably get going. It's pretty late. I'm sorry. I...,Ted
3557,"Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.",Robin
3558,Can I call you tomorrow?,Ted
3559,Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.,Robin
3560,"Okay. Good night, Robin.",Ted
3561,"Good night, Ted.",Robin
3562,"Oh, my God. We're making out.",Robin
3563,Right.,Ted
3564,This is crazy.,Robin
3565,Right? Right?,Ted
3566,"Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...",Robin
3567,Yeah.,Ted
3568,Yeah?,Robin
3569,"Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.",Ted
3570,Okay.,Robin
3571,Stop doing that.,Ted
3572,"I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.",Ted
3573,What do you want from me? People break up. It happens.,Ted
3574,It's not ideal.,Ted
3575,"Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?",Barney
3576,I think he just spat on me.,Lily
3577,"Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going.",Marshall
3578,"No! No, come on.",Barney
3579,Yes!,Marshall
3580,"Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the &quot;le&quot;. We still got the &quot;gen.&quot; The &quot;da.&quot; The &quot;ry.&quot;",Barney
3581,"Okay, if we're at the &quot;le,&quot; then I say we follow it up with a &quot;t's go home.&quot;",Lily
3582,"Oh, wow, you just got b*rned, phonics style.",Marshall
3583,"Okay, seriously.",Lily
3584,"Hey, you guys remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards?",Marshall
3585,You're right. I owe you a real breakup call. I'll call you tomorrow.,Ted
3586,"Why should I have to go home? You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry.",Ted
3587,"It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the g*n by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Robin. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay.",Ted
3588,"Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night.",Ted
3589,This isn't my phone.,Ted
3590,"Okay. Bye. <em>(She hungs up)</em> I thought it was mine, so I answered it.",Robin
3591,Was it...?,Ted
3592,It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.,Robin
3593,"Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set? Disc three. My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone? Come on. Disc three! God, Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours.",Ted
3594,What do you mean &quot;could&quot;?,Lily
3595,"I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.",Ted
3596,"Trust that impulse, Ted.",Barney
3597,"Hey. Something kind of cool just happened. My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award.",Robin
3598,A... LAME-A?,Lily
3599,"We prefer Local Area Media Award. Um... there's going to be this big banquet. I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came. And there's an open bar.",Robin
3600,"Yeah, put me down for two.",Ted
3601,Really? It's three months away.,Robin
3602,"I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time.",Ted
3603,I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.,Ted
3604,You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?,Barney
3605,"Yes, that's what I meant by &quot;you know.&quot; I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls. Look, I shouldn't go.",Ted
3606,"You should definitely go. Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her.",Marshall
3607,"Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs.",Barney
3608,That's only two.,Ted
3609,Count again.,Barney
3610,"Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours.",Ted
3611,So get an escort.,Barney
3612,"By &quot;escort,&quot; you mean prostitute?",Ted
3613,Why not?,Barney
3614,Because... gross?,Ted
3615,"Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.",Barney
3616,You really think that's true?,Marshall
3617,"Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out.",Barney
3618,"Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen. Kaboom! You've been lawyered.",Marshall
3619,"Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun.",Barney
3620,"Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have sex with?",Ted
3621,Yes.,Barney
3622,No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?,Ted
3623,"That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.",Barney
3624,You just made that up.,Marshall
3625,Withdrawn.,Barney
3626,"Lawyered. The point is, how long has it been?",Marshall
3627,57 days.,Ted
3628,Is that your water? May I?,Barney
3629,"Yeah, go ahead.",Ted
3630,"Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump.",Barney
3631,"No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.",Ted
3632,"Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool.",Barney
3633,"Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp.",Ted
3634,You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic? That's racism. And I do not drink with r*cist. Good day.,Barney
3635,"You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can...",Ted
3636,I said good day!,Barney
3637,So should I wear my hair up or down? Lily.,Robin
3638,What?,Lily
3639,You okay?,Robin
3640,"Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm just exhausted from work. The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day. It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap.",Lily
3641,"Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were? Is that safe?",Robin
3642,"Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me?",Lily
3643,"Ted's still coming to this thing, right?",Robin
3644,Yep.,Lily
3645,"Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?",Robin
3646,"Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous.",Lily
3647,"No, it's just this guy at the station. I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes. Is it going to be weird?",Robin
3648,"No, it's not going to be weird at all. (<em>Lily's on the phone with Marshall</em>) Robin's bringing a date.",Lily
3649,Boy. That's going to be really weird.,Marshall
3650,I know.,Lily
3651,Robin's bringing a date.,Marshall
3652,Oh. Okay. That's not weird. She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on.,Ted
3653,"Dude, it's going to be weird.",Marshall
3654,"No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird.",Ted
3655,"Yeah, it won't be weird.",Barney
3656,Thank you.,Ted
3657,Because you're going to bring your own date.,Barney
3658,"Hi, Mary. Have you met Ted?",Barney
3659,"Hi, Mary. Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too.",Ted
3660,"Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Barney.",Ted
3661,"See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable.",Barney
3662,What the hell?,Ted
3663,"Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow. So I got you a date for the evening.",Barney
3664,You got me a hooker. A really hot hook-- A hooker!,Ted
3665,"Think about it, this is perfect. A: it will make Robin insanely jealous... B: you get to have sex with her... and C: maybe by getting to know Mary, you'll come to see that courtesans are people, too. And D: &quot;B&quot; all night long.",Barney
3666,I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet.,Ted
3667,"The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall. No one will suspect a thing. They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and... Okay, that's a little bit suspicious. Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight. But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever.",Barney
3668,500 bucks?,Ted
3669,"Ted, you're my cabron. You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tr*nny from the Port Authority? Look at how hot she is. Robin would be so jealous.",Barney
3670,"I'm not trying to make Robin jealous, Barney. Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul.",Ted
3671,Check out Robin's date.,Marshall
3672,I know.,Ted
3673,Is that who I think it is?,Marshall
3674,Yep. It's Sandy Rivers.,Ted
3675,Sandy time. Sandy time!,Ted
3676,"Which Sandy do we want today? French Sandy, p*rn star Sandy...?",Ted
3677,"Yosemite Sandy, definitely.",Marshall
3678,Excellent choice. I love this guy.,Ted
3679,I hate this guy.,Ted
3680,Hey.,Lily
3681,I'm Lily.,Lily
3682,"Mary is a friend of Barney's. Barney invited her. Just met Mary ourselves. Don't know too much about Mary. Look, a beer.",Marshall
3683,Hey.,Ted
3684,Hi.,Robin
3685,You look nice.,Ted
3686,"Oh, um, Ted, this is Sandy.",Robin
3687,"Hi, Sandy. Rivers. So are you two, uh...",Ted
3688,"Oh, how rude of me. Uh, Robin, Sandy... Rivers... this is Mary, my date.",Ted
3689,"Man, Vampire Lou just looks great.",Marshall
3690,I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker.,Ted
3691,"Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together, man. Secrets come out in there.",Marshall
3692,"Oh, please. How's it's going to come out? &quot;Uh, pass me a towel. P.S., I have sex for money.&quot;",Barney
3693,Who has sex for money?,Lily
3694,Nobody. What did you guys talk about in there? Anything interesting?,Marshall
3695,"No, not really. We just chitchatted and I borrowed her lipstick. Why is Vampire Lou the host of a Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie? You know, it just makes no sense. God, that pisses me off.",Lily
3696,"Lily, you okay?",Ted
3697,"Oh, yeah, I'm just tired. And when I get tired, I get cranky.",Lily
3698,&quot;Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.&quot;,Lily
3699,"Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time.",Lily
3700,"Lily, quit your job. Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board, and you'll make a ton more money.",Barney
3701,"Well, guess what, Barney? I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make, unlike you and, sadly, my fiance.",Lily
3702,"Well, it's just an internship, for the record.",Marshall
3703,"Yeah, because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck, what would that make me?",Lily
3704,"Exactly. Thank you, Mary.",Lily
3705,"So, Mary, what do you do for a living?",Robin
3706,She's a paralegal.,Barney
3707,"Oh, so, Mary the paralegal. What does a paralegal do exactly?",Robin
3708,"Oh, what firm?",Lily
3709,That's a real law firm.,Marshall
3710,Nice.,Marshall
3711,You're pretty good on your feet.,Ted
3712,Is that allowed?,Ted
3713,"You know, I wouldn't normally say this on a first date, but... well, considering... I'm just going to say it. You are so hot!",Ted
3714,You're welcome.,Ted
3715,"Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him. Don't let him out of your sight for a minute.",Robin
3716,"So, Sandy, what do you do? Oh, wait, I know what you do. You're the guy who reads the paper in the morning.",Ted
3717,"Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning. But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect where I make an actual contribution to the world. I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific.",Ted
3718,"You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love. Damn, you just got even hotter.",Ted
3719,Hey.,Ted
3720,"Hey. Mary seems nice. Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?",Robin
3721,"I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened.",Ted
3722,"And just like that, it's all okay. Roll credits.",Robin
3723,"So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now?",Ted
3724,We're still friends.,Robin
3725,"Are we? You don't return my calls, we never hang out and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?",Ted
3726,"Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?",Robin
3727,"Oh, so now she's a whore?",Ted
3728,What?,Robin
3729,"You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome. And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous, I came here to support you as a friend. And frankly, I'm sick of trying.",Ted
3730,Hey.,Ted
3731,"Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome.",Ted
3732,"Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel. You should see the rooms. The views are amazing.",Ted
3733,"Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts. Actually, don't use the mini-bar. Do it. Come on, Ted, do it. This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.",Barney
3734,Sleep with a prostitute?,Ted
3735,"No, lose your virginity. What up. Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships.",Barney
3736,You just made that up.,Marshall
3737,Withdrawn.,Barney
3738,"Lawyered. Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up. And second of all, you cannot do this. It's wrong on every level. And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed.",Marshall
3739,I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame. She's really cool.,Ted
3740,"Yeah, well... there we go.",Marshall
3741,"Thanks. Oh, wow. This is really a surprise. Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends. They're all here tonight. Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers... Barney... And that's it. Those are all my friends. Thank you.",Robin
3742,Congratulations.,Marshall
3743,"Oh, thanks. Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab?",Robin
3744,"Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs? We, uh, got a room.",Ted
3745,"Dude, what are you doing?",Marshall
3746,What's it look like?,Ted
3747,"It looks bad, is what it looks like. You cannot do this.",Marshall
3748,"Marshall, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her. Besides, I'm trying to make Robin jealous.",Ted
3749,"Oh, that's real mature.",Marshall
3750,"Marshall, what is up with you and Ted?",Lily
3751,"Nothing, baby. Don't worry about it. Fine. Do what you want. Hey.",Marshall
3752,Yeah. Thanks. Well... Good night.,Ted
3753,Good night.,Robin
3754,"So, did you and Barney ever...?",Ted
3755,"Oh, thank God.",Ted
3756,"Wow, so they're...? Robin, where's Sandy Rivers?",Marshall
3757,I put him in a cab.,Robin
3758,So you and he aren't...?,Barney
3759,I don't date people I work with. I was just trying to make Ted jealous. Is he...?,Robin
3760,He's off trying to make you jealous.,Marshall
3761,"Oh, well, good for them. And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool.",Robin
3762,"Lily, I know you're asleep, but I have to tell someone this, and we tell each other everything. So, here it goes. Mary's not a paralegal. She's a prostitute.",Marshall
3763,What?!,Robin
3764,Barney paid for her.,Marshall
3765,Is that true?,Lily
3766,"We were having a conversation about prostitution, and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar and now she and Ted are upstairs.",Marshall
3767,"Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately? Is he having a nervous breakdown?",Robin
3768,"You know, Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low, but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle. Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah!",Lily
3769,That's her napkin.,Marshall
3770,No!,Lily
3771,"Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any. In keeping with tonight's award show motif, I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending! Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?",Barney
3772,What?,Marshall
3773,"That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.",Barney
3774,So she's not...?,Marshall
3775,"No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.",Barney
3776,I feel kind of like Richard Gere.,Ted
3777,"No. You know, Mary, I've never done this before.",Ted
3778,"You know, been... on a &quot;date.&quot;",Ted
3779,"No. Why, is that so odd?",Ted
3780,"God, you were just a kid. Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and...",Ted
3781,Must be tough.,Ted
3782,"Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot. I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this. You're a hooker.",Ted
3783,"Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me. I'm not going to have sex with a prostitute.",Ted
3784,"Come on, Mary, there's no one else around. You're a hooker.",Ted
3785,"No, you're a hooker.",Ted
3786,You're a paralegal.,Ted
3787,That was not funny.,Ted
3788,"Not funny, dude.",Marshall
3789,"I know, it was hilarious.",Barney
3790,Why would you do that?,Ted
3791,I did it to prove a point.,Barney
3792,What point?,Ted
3793,"Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date. All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet and your slump is over.",Barney
3794,"So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?",Ted
3795,"Come on, dude, you should be thanking me.",Barney
3796,She slapped me and stormed off.,Ted
3797,Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.,Barney
3798,"I'm sorry, dude, it was funny.",Marshall
3799,"Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room.",Ted
3800,Your room?,Barney
3801,"Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card-- never checked out. By the way, you know what's super fun? Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain. Well, it's almost 3:00. Got a massage. Toodles.",Ted
3802,"Come on, if you don't laugh, it just seems mean.",Marshall
3803,Van Smoot is available.,Marshall
3804,"Oh, my God!",Lily
3805,There was a cancellation two months from now.,Marshall
3806,You want to have our wedding in two months? No. It's impossible.,Lily
3807,"It's Van Smoot, Lily. It's the dream!",Marshall
3808,"No, there's just not enough time. There's no way... Oh! Mini-vomit.",Lily
3809,"Okay, look, look, look. I know that it's sudden, but check it. If we don't take this, guess who's on their way with a deposit check.",Marshall
3810,Todd and Valerie?,Lily
3811,We got to make a decision. Todd and Valerie are in motion. Van Smoot!,Marshall
3812,"Oh! Kids, color!<em>(Lily runs out of class, Marshall runs out pf the appartment, they join in the street)</em> Come on, baby.",Lily
3813,"Come on, come on, come on.",Marshall
3814,Todd. Valerie. Stairs.,Marshall
3815,I can't believe it. We got Van Smoot House.,Lily
3816,It is on. It is on! Like the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.,Marshall
3817,What?,Robin
3818,You're a wonder.,Marshall
3819,Wow! You guys are getting married in two months.,Ted
3820,How are you going to get everything done?,Robin
3821,"Division of labor. Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up. Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist.",Lily
3822,Was it...?,Ted
3823,It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.,Robin
3824,"Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist? And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations.",Lily
3825,"Wow. That was really awkward, Lil. And still. It's still really awkward right now.",Marshall
3826,"Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?",Barney
3827,"Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me.",Lily
3828,"Lil, you know I can't promise that.",Barney
3829,"Shh! Shh! Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out. Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad.",Marshall
3830,Crap! Band! We forgot a band! It's just gonna be silence and then people chewing.,Lily
3831,"Shh! Shh! Baby, don't worry about it. I called The 88!",Marshall
3832,Who?,Lily
3833,The 88. They're this awesome band. They played my law review party. They were found guilty. On three counts of rocking.,Marshall
3834,"I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding, they were great.",Ted
3835,John &quot;Bonzo&quot; Bonham from Led Zeppelin?,Lily
3836,"Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer from Led Zeppelin, who died in 1980, got married two months ago.",Ted
3837,"Look, I... I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen. We... we don't even know if they can play our song. They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition.",Lily
3838,"Baby, The 88 don't audition. They're, like, the Wiggles of wedding bands.",Marshall
3839,"Well, then... I have to say no.",Lily
3840,"Baby, they're only holding the date until Monday.",Marshall
3841,"Well... well, are they playing anywhere this weekend?",Lily
3842,Let me check their Website.,Marshall
3843,What?,Lily
3844,"Lily, you're being a wee bit intense about this band thing.",Ted
3845,"Intense? I have a wedding to plan in nine weeks for 200 people. Even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt and consume this coffee table, I need you to roll with it, okay?",Lily
3846,Wow.,Ted
3847,Guys! I just tasted an amazing caterer.,Barney
3848,We already have a caterer.,Lily
3849,"Oh, right. You're getting married. You see what I did there? Took a...",Barney
3850,It looks like The 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow.,Marshall
3851,A prom? Can... can we go to that?,Lily
3852,"Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch.",Marshall
3853,"Yeah. No, they won't.",Lily
3854,Why not?,Marshall
3855,'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.,Lily
3856,"No sweat, we'll just sneak in.",Barney
3857,We're not sneaking in to a high school prom.,Marshall
3858,"Yes, we are. It's the only way.",Lily
3859,"You're getting on board with Barney's idea? Man, you really have snapped.",Ted
3860,"It's nine weeks till the wedding. At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything.",Lily
3861,Well...,Barney
3862,"No, Barney.",Lily
3863,I'll go with you.,Robin
3864,Really?,Lily
3865,Yeah. I never got to go to my prom. We always had field hockey nationals in the spring.,Robin
3866,Lesbian.,Barney
3867,The cough is supposed to cover the &quot;lesbian.&quot;,Robin
3868,"No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate.",Barney
3869,Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?,Lily
3870,"Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep, and you've got &quot;statutory&quot; written all over your body.",Barney
3871,"Hey, why don't we all go?",Ted
3872,I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in. We don't want to mess things up for Lily.,Robin
3873,"Yeah, you're right. Besides, Marshall and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding. Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?",Ted
3874,Sounds awesome. We should go out and just get freakin' weird.,Marshall
3875,Yeah.,Ted
3876,"'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw.",Marshall
3877,"Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear? Lame! But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later.",Barney
3878,"All right, what do you think?",Lily
3879,Horrible.,Barney
3880,You're gonna make such a great dad.,Lily
3881,"You look so classy and nice. You're going to stick out like a sore thumb. Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days, with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris? They all dress like strippers. It's go ho or go home.",Barney
3882,"Well, we have to get in. I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday, 'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have...",Lily
3883,"Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay? Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it.",Robin
3884,All right.,Lily
3885,"That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!",Barney
3886,"I never thought this would be a bad thing, but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.",Robin
3887,I didn't know I still had this.,Lily
3888,What?,Robin
3889,The dress I wore to my actual prom.,Lily
3890,"Aw, you look great, too, Scooter.",Lily
3891,"Oh, disco! I am so happy for you.",Lily
3892,"Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday.",Lily
3893,"Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing.",Barney
3894,"No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore...",Robin
3895,Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.,Barney
3896,Aw. Sweet. Thank you.,Lily
3897,"Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?",Barney
3898,"No. I've never been to prom before, okay?",Robin
3899,We got to go. See ya.,Lily
3900,"Bye, have fun. See you.",Ted
3901,"They grow up into skanks so fast, don't they, Ted?",Marshall
3902,"So, what, we ready for tonight?",Ted
3903,Yeah. Just one thing we got to do first.,Marshall
3904,sh*t of Jim Beam?,Ted
3905,Yeah.,Marshall
3906,Yes!,Ted
3907,And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff 200 wedding invitations.,Marshall
3908,What?!,Ted
3909,"I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is.",Marshall
3910,"Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break. Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad, but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad.",Ted
3911,"Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it. First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize.",Marshall
3912,"Do I look like I'm four? All right, what kind of prize are we talking?",Ted
3913,"Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids.",Lily
3914,Is this gonna work?,Robin
3915,"Yeah. Look, when I was 17, I used to sneak into clubs all the time. It's all about confidence. Follow me. Whee-hoo! Happy prom, everybody. Going to prom-- whee-hoo!",Lily
3916,"Okay, bye. Okay, look, I just need to see the band. I'm getting married in two months, and...",Lily
3917,"Hey, ho, hey!",Barney
3918,Wow. &quot;Ma'am?&quot; Check and mate.,Lily
3919,"It's cool. Time to activate plan B. Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow? Scherbotsky?",Barney
3920,"Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?",Robin
3921,For free.,Robin
3922,"Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily.",Robin
3923,Hi. Shall we?,Lily
3924,"Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?",Robin
3925,Don't worry about me. I'll get in. Oh... I'll get in.,Barney
3926,We're in!,Lily
3927,"Oh, you're kidding me.",Lily
3928,"Yeah, what the hell? It's prom. That tastes like cough syrup.",Robin
3929,"Nerds who aren't good at math? Life's going to be rough, boys.",Robin
3930,"Hi. Excuse me. I was wondering if you guys could play &quot;Good Feeling&quot; by the Violent Femmes. I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married and my fiancÃ© wants to hire you guys as the band, but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play &quot;Good Feeling&quot; because that's our song, and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?",Lily
3931,My phlegm feels looser.,Robin
3932,"This is pathetic. It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights. If I got in a fight, would you have my back?",Ted
3933,You know it.,Marshall
3934,"I'd have your back, too.",Ted
3935,That's cool.,Marshall
3936,"What, you don't think you'd need my help? You don't know what I can do. I'm like... like a berserker.",Ted
3937,"Okay, Ted. <em>(His phone starts rigging)</em> Hello.",Marshall
3938,"Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music for &quot;Good Feeling&quot; and bring it out here, like, now.",Robin
3939,Hang on. It's Robin. She wants me to go to prom. Can Ted come?,Marshall
3940,Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame! I don't even want to go anyway.,Ted
3941,"Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us.",Robin
3942,What'd she say? What'd she say?,Ted
3943,"He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me. I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive. Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's, it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes.",Robin
3944,"Okay, bye. She totally wants you to come.",Marshall
3945,"All right, sheet music's on the way. Are you okay?",Robin
3946,There's just so much to do for this wedding. My head is swirling. It's just all moving too fast.,Lily
3947,I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already.,Lily
3948,"Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us.",Lily
3949,"There's still so much I want to do. I want to travel, live overseas as an artist, maybe have a lesbian relationship. Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain.",Lily
3950,Please don't put that kind of pressure on me! It's too much!,Lily
3951,What?,Lily
3952,"Well, we did promise them one dance.",Robin
3953,"Yeah, sure, okay. So Andrew, what's your big plan? What's life going to be like after tonight?",Lily
3954,"No, you won't.",Lily
3955,"No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to. You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old before your time wondering &quot;Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?&quot;",Lily
3956,"Oh, Sean, look, um, you're a nice guy, but I just don't... No, you're not getting lucky tonight.",Robin
3957,Okay.,Ted
3958,"What's it to you, giant turtle?",Marshall
3959,"Oh, hey. Where's Lily?",Marshall
3960,She's in the bathroom.,Barney
3961,"Wait here, I should go talk to the band.",Marshall
3962,All right.,Ted
3963,How did you guys get in here?,Barney
3964,We just snuck in the back.,Ted
3965,You just snu... Are you serious? I've been trying to get in here all night. I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume.,Barney
3966,But you got in. Slow and steady won the race.,Ted
3967,"Hey, bro, have you seen my fiancÃ©e Lily?",Marshall
3968,"Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom and the adrenaline's pumping, but...",Marshall
3969,"Whoa, whoa. Look, let's not get carried away.",Marshall
3970,I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior.,Lily
3971,"I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me. I'm going to ask you something and, um, maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever. But, um, are you having second thoughts?",Robin
3972,Yeah. But not about Marshall. About me. I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago and wondering what happened to her.,Lily
3973,"I don't want to be tied down. I want to live in France and Spain and Italy and just soak up life and put it on a canvas, even if it means being a waitress in crappy cafÃ©s for five years, I don't care. I'm going to be a painter. And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know? But anyway, I'm blabbering. Way to make new friends, Lily. I'm sorry. What was your name again?",Lily
3974,"Nice to meet you, Marshall. Guess we're hallmates.",Lily
3975,Yeah.,Marshall
3976,It works.,Lily
3977,Violent Femmes. I love this song.,Marshall
3978,"Me, too.",Lily
3979,"I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to. The travel, the bohemian art life, my big lesbian experience. I didn't do any of it.",Lily
3980,"Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world. I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined?",Robin
3981,Yeah.,Lily
3982,"And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint. And as far as your lesbian experience... Happy?",Robin
3983,"Yeah. So field hockey, huh?",Lily
3984,Shut up.,Robin
3985,"Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus. You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here.",Ted
3986,I totally could have taken that kid.,Marshall
3987,"Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so...",Ted
3988,"Well, I don't need it, but thanks.",Marshall
3989,"Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome.",Ted
3990,"No, the kid was totally, like, a white belt and I'm gigantic. Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need to get in there for one more song.",Marshall
3991,"You guys will thank me for this later, okay? Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...?",Barney
3992,"You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly quick.",Ted
3993,So how was your first prom?,Ted
3994,"You tell me. I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me, there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl.",Robin
3995,"So, basically, it was a prom.",Ted
3996,"Okay, I've missed you. Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way, not even in an I-forgive-you way. Just in a I've-missed-you way.",Robin
3997,I'll take what I can get.,Ted
3998,"And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth when you wear jeans to a strip club.",Barney
3999,"So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song.",Marshall
4000,"Yeah, it's good.",Lily
4001,"Band? Check. Two months, baby. Two months.",Marshall
4002,Two months.,Lily
4003,Thank you.,Ted
4004,"'Kay. Oh, go on, touch it.",Ted
4005,"Ah! Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.",Lily
4006,"All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?",Ted
4007,"Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this.",Robin
4008,"I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted.",Barney
4009,"You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy.",Marshall
4010,"Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time. Barney.",Ted
4011,"Oy, gevalt.",Marshall
4012,"Ah... Happy birthday, Ted.",Barney
4013,Whoo-hoo!,Ted
4014,"Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y... Oh, my God.",Barney
4015,Oh! Call an ambulance!,Barney
4016,"Try not to speak. Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk.",Barney
4017,"I'm serious, call 911.",Barney
4018,"Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try... Here, have some water. Water! Here, drink this. Shh! Shh!",Barney
4019,"You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.",Robin
4020,Wait for it.,Ted
4021,"28. Two more 'til the big one, three-oh.",Lily
4022,"Still, you know, another year older. Still single. You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking?",Lily
4023,Nope. I hit the snooze button.,Ted
4024,And here come the paramedics.,Robin
4025,"Oh, thank God, you're here.",Barney
4026,I think there might be some internal bleeding. Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital.,Barney
4027,You've had a terrible fall.,Barney
4028,Really? 'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven. Angel... Give him your number. What? Give him your number. What?,Barney
4029,"Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.",Barney
4030,What are you...? Come on. They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number.,Barney
4031,It works!,Barney
4032,I cannot believe that she gave him her number.,Marshall
4033,Maybe she really does have a brain injury.,Robin
4034,"Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun. It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys. Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good.",Barney
4035,"I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.",Ted
4036,"Well, what's perfect?",Lily
4037,It's not like I have a list.,Ted
4038,"Oh, yes, you do.",Robin
4039,"Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...",Ted
4040,That's not hard. I know at least...,Lily
4041,"I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.",Ted
4042,Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.,Marshall
4043,"Any Kim from any cool band, really. Can't be too picky.",Ted
4044,You're never going to find this girl.,Lily
4045,Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me. I am done trying to plan the unplannable.,Ted
4046,"So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?",Marshall
4047,That's the plan.,Ted
4048,"Whoa, you're up early.",Ted
4049,"Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.",Lily
4050,Does Marshall know?,Ted
4051,He's still sound asleep.,Lily
4052,"Awesome. So awesome. God! Best girl ever. Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.",Marshall
4053,"Please don't do that. Hey, is this milk any good?",Ted
4054,"Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.",Marshall
4055,"God, why didn't you throw it away?",Ted
4056,I'm going shopping after work. I'll pick up some milk.,Lily
4057,Oh...! These pancakes are delightful.,Marshall
4058,"What's wrong, baby?",Lily
4059,This is the high point of my day.,Marshall
4060,"Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.",Marshall
4061,Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.,Barney
4062,"I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do.",Marshall
4063,"Just take a look, will ya? Okay, corner office. Top floor. Check out that guy. Name's Clark Butterfield. He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs.",Barney
4064,So?,Marshall
4065,"So guess what I did to that sandwich? Here, I took a picture.",Barney
4066,Oh! Sweet Lord.,Marshall
4067,And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.,Barney
4068,Ooh! Duck! That is sick! Why would you do that?,Marshall
4069,Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first sh*t.,Barney
4070,You?,Marshall
4071,"Totally. Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great.",Barney
4072,What?,Marshall
4073,"Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern. This is w*r, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.",Barney
4074,This is stupid.,Marshall
4075,"Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering k*ll. I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.",Barney
4076,"This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.",Marshall
4077,"Tracy, could you come in here, please? Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him.",Barney
4078,"I get it. Thank you, Tracy.",Marshall
4079,Hello?,Ted
4080,Speaking.,Ted
4081,"Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.",Ted
4082,I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?,Ted
4083,So I'm in good hands. You found me a match?,Ted
4084,"No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.",Ted
4085,"All right, fine. Set it up.",Ted
4086,"You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?",Marshall
4087,Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.,Barney
4088,Tastes normal to me.,Marshall
4089,"That's what I thought, too. Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.",Barney
4090,"Oh, God!",Marshall
4091,It got me as well.,Barney
4092,"Well, then why did you have me drink it?!",Marshall
4093,Because now... you're in.,Barney
4094,Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that bastard pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first?,Marshall
4095,"Yeah, it's probably a good idea.",Barney
4096,Lily?,Ted
4097,"Hey, Ted, are you busy?",Lily
4098,Um... yes.,Ted
4099,"Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot. Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?",Lily
4100,What? What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?,Ted
4101,"Marshall can't know about this. Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story. Can you please hurry?",Lily
4102,"I can't, I'm waiting...",Ted
4103,"Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand? No, drifter, no!",Lily
4104,"Come on, Lily.",Ted
4105,But you see my point.,Lily
4106,"All right, stay there. I'm on my way.",Ted
4107,"Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date?",Lily
4108,Yes.,Ted
4109,And was she okay about pushing it back?,Lily
4110,Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?,Ted
4111,You can never tell Marshall.,Lily
4112,I won't.,Ted
4113,Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.,Lily
4114,I swear on Luke and Leia.,Ted
4115,"About a month ago, I started getting insomnia. Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time. But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.",Lily
4116,Did you talk to Marshall about it?,Ted
4117,"He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super b*mb Man...",Lily
4118,That was you? Awesome!,Ted
4119,"I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.",Lily
4120,Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.,Ted
4121,"San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven.",Lily
4122,You don't want to get married.,Ted
4123,Of course I want to get married. I... It's not like I was ever going to do it. I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.,Lily
4124,"Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means.",Ted
4125,"Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid.",Lily
4126,I don't think you're stupid.,Ted
4127,I love Marshall.,Lily
4128,I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.,Ted
4129,But why am I the only one? How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?,Lily
4130,So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.,Marshall
4131,All done.,Ted
4132,"Ted, let's go to New Haven.",Lily
4133,"Lily, don't do this to yourself.",Ted
4134,"I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure.",Lily
4135,"No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.",Ted
4136,"Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, &quot;Yep. That was a mistake.&quot; So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you?",Lily
4137,"I don't know. You said &quot;mistake&quot; a lot. Lily, don't do this.",Ted
4138,"Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.",Lily
4139,"Forgive you for what? <em>(Lily leaves with he car)</em> Lily. Lily! Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road. I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk... Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to k*ll you. And, also, I texted you the same thing. <em>(He calls Barney)</em> Hey, I need a big favor.",Ted
4140,"Anything, bro.",Barney
4141,I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.,Ted
4142,No.,Barney
4143,It's kind of an emergency.,Ted
4144,What are you doing in Duchess County?,Barney
4145,Apple picking. Can you just get up here?,Ted
4146,"I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work. We're kind of swamped.",Barney
4147,Is that Ted?,Marshall
4148,Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County.,Barney
4149,Don't you have a big date tonight?,Marshall
4150,"Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.",Ted
4151,So what are you doing in Duchess County?,Marshall
4152,Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!,Ted
4153,"Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you.",Marshall
4154,No!,Ted
4155,"Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.",Marshall
4156,"No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank. I'm not in Duchess County.",Ted
4157,So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County?,Marshall
4158,Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.,Ted
4159,"Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield.",Barney
4160,"You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously. Which is great, and everything, but I can't imagine having this much fun over there.",Marshall
4161,You thinking about coming to work here full-time?,Barney
4162,"Maybe. Don't tell Lily, okay?",Marshall
4163,"Thanks, Tracy.",Barney
4164,Of course we are. Were you going to think of that?,Barney
4165,No.,Marshall
4166,That would have been bad.,Barney
4167,Horrible.,Marshall
4168,"Need a ride, cowboy?",Robin
4169,Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.,Ted
4170,"Hmm, too bad. I got candy.",Robin
4171,Candy?!,Ted
4172,So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?,Robin
4173,Nope. Sworn to secrecy.,Ted
4174,"Oh, come on.",Robin
4175,I like your hat.,Ted
4176,Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights.,Robin
4177,"Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine.",Ted
4178,"Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took &quot;highlights&quot; to mean, &quot;I want to look like a tiger,&quot; hence the hat.",Robin
4179,Oh. I gotta see this.,Ted
4180,No way.,Robin
4181,Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat!,Ted
4182,"So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?",Robin
4183,"Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.",Ted
4184,"Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.",Robin
4185,"Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.",Ted
4186,I read that. More like &quot;Love in the Time of Don't Bothera.&quot;,Robin
4187,"You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.",Ted
4188,We're not indoors. We're in a van.,Robin
4189,Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.,Ted
4190,Never. What else?,Robin
4191,She loves lasagna.,Ted
4192,Barf.,Robin
4193,"You know, I am sensing a pattern here.",Ted
4194,What else?,Robin
4195,"Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.",Ted
4196,And she's looking to get married and have kids?,Robin
4197,Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl.,Ted
4198,"Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids.",Robin
4199,Really? You don't want kids?,Ted
4200,"You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8:56. You're early.",Robin
4201,"Hey, thanks for picking me up.",Ted
4202,Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for.,Robin
4203,Thanks.,Ted
4204,"All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.",Robin
4205,You're going to show me your hair?,Ted
4206,"Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.",Robin
4207,You just made my night.,Ted
4208,Go.,Robin
4209,"Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice. Oh, hey, dude.",Marshall
4210,"Hey, guys.",Ted
4211,Hi.,Lily
4212,"Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?",Ted
4213,"Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.",Lily
4214,You think you might want to... drink the milk?,Ted
4215,"No. Nope, I'm good. I don't need any milk.",Lily
4216,"Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date. How'd it go, dude?",Marshall
4217,I didn't go.,Ted
4218,What? Why?,Marshall
4219,I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.,Ted
4220,Why? She sounds perfect.,Marshall
4221,I don't want perfect. I want Robin.,Ted
4222,"Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake.",Marshall
4223,Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make.,Ted
4224,Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence. You and Robin have tried this again and again...,Marshall
4225,"Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.",Lily
4226,"Hey, is this milk any good?",Ted
4227,So... what do you think?,Ted
4228,"Robin again? Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together. Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.",Barney
4229,But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?,Ted
4230,Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills. Anybody else get chills?,Marshall
4231,"Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Robin, so... I gotta do this. <em>(Barney slaps him)</em> Ow! What the hell?",Ted
4232,That wasn't me. That was the universe.,Barney
4233,"Thanks, Lou. Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend.",Robin
4234,Guess we'll have to take a rain check.,Robin
4235,Have a great night.,Robin
4236,"Well, I'd give you the &quot;I don't date coworkers&quot; speech again, but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now.",Robin
4237,"Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash and burn before you say, &quot;enough&quot;?",Marshall
4238,"One more. One more time. One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture. And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it. If it's yes, great. If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever.",Ted
4239,"So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?",Lily
4240,"I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment.",Ted
4241,"I see where this is going. Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work... usually. The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999. The characters: Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name...",Barney
4242,"Universe. So, this plan you speak of?",Lily
4243,Remember the first night Robin and I went out? I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.,Ted
4244,"Yeah. Dude, that was awesome, but how are you ever going to top that?",Marshall
4245,She should be here any second.,Ted
4246,"Enough with the... we'll go get pizza later, all right? Just...",Ted
4247,Damn it.,Robin
4248,Hello.,Lily
4249,"Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key.",Robin
4250,Extra key? Do I have an extra key to your apartment?,Lily
4251,"Yes, I gave it to you.",Robin
4252,"Oh, right. That key. Yeah, I lost it.",Lily
4253,"Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith.",Robin
4254,"No, wait, uh... Maybe you should just knock.",Lily
4255,"Knock? Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained.",Robin
4256,"Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay?",Lily
4257,Summer fellowship?,Marshall
4258,Just knock. Okay.,Robin
4259,Hi.,Ted
4260,Hi.,Robin
4261,"Robin... I've sort of said this already. I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly. So this is me, just saying it. With strings. I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together. What do you say? What do you say?",Ted
4262,Yes. No. I don't know.,Robin
4263,Those are the three options.,Ted
4264,"Ted, this is so...",Robin
4265,I know.,Ted
4266,"I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and... I have to pee.",Robin
4267,"Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait.",Ted
4268,"No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards. Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here.",Ted
4269,Okay. Let's talk.,Robin
4270,"Okay. Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?",Ted
4271,"Thanks, guys. Just need a minute. Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though. Kind of an inside joke. Thanks. <em>(The musicians leave)</em> You're crazy.",Robin
4272,Right. Come on.,Ted
4273,"It's not that I haven't thought about this. You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay? We only just started being friends again.",Robin
4274,I know. But... come on...,Ted
4275,"And we want different things. That's still there. That's not going away. I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out and I'd lose you as a friend? I gotta think about this.",Robin
4276,"Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane. Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious. I'm kidding. I'm serious.",Ted
4277,"I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping.",Robin
4278,I thought that thing was canceled.,Ted
4279,"Well, it's back on.",Robin
4280,Since when?,Ted
4281,Since like an hour ago.,Robin
4282,You're leaving?,Robin
4283,"Oh, congratulations.",Robin
4284,What do you mean?,Robin
4285,"Wow. Thanks. And, yes.",Robin
4286,"Yes, let's go get dinner.",Robin
4287,"Oh, you're kidding me. No way. Don't go on this thing.",Ted
4288,"Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip.",Robin
4289,Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date. With Sandy... and his weenie. I mean is this not a date?,Ted
4290,I don't-I don't know.,Robin
4291,"So, what? You actually like this guy now?",Ted
4292,I don't know.,Robin
4293,Are you gonna hook up with him?,Ted
4294,I don't know.,Robin
4295,"Yes, you do.",Ted
4296,"No, Ted, I don't. And you know what? That's okay. I don't plan out every second of my life like you do.",Robin
4297,I don't plan out every...,Ted
4298,"Oh, really? What is all of this? I mean, why can't you just say, &quot;Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?&quot; No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates and let's spend the rest of our lives together.",Robin
4299,"Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point? God, you are so terrified of anything real. It's like you're floating out in space. Touch the ground, Robin. Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake.",Ted
4300,I need to think about this.,Robin
4301,Fine.,Ted
4302,"No, I'm sorry, I... I can't do this anymore. I need an answer.",Robin
4303,"If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that.",Ted
4304,"Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no.",Robin
4305,Then I guess it's not meant to be.,Ted
4306,"Nice try, buddy.",Barney
4307,Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure. She's made her choice and you can finally move on.,Marshall
4308,Screw that. This ain't over.,Ted
4309,"Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said...",Marshall
4310,"I don't care what I said. This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be. It is meant to be, and you know why? 'Cause I mean it to be.",Ted
4311,Unpause?,Lily
4312,Unpause.,Marshall
4313,A painting fellowship?,Marshall
4314,I was never going to take it.,Lily
4315,In California?,Marshall
4316,I was never going to take it.,Lily
4317,"Ted, she is going on that camping trip. Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.",Barney
4318,"Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is.",Ted
4319,What are you talking about?,Barney
4320,I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain!,Ted
4321,"Ted, do you want me to slap you again? 'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.",Barney
4322,"Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?",Ted
4323,Yeah.,Barney
4324,Are you still in touch with her?,Ted
4325,"Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having sex, we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up, and of course I'm not in touch with her!",Barney
4326,"Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.",Ted
4327,Did you just say a &quot;rain dance&quot;?,Barney
4328,Yes.,Ted
4329,A rain dance.,Barney
4330,Yes.,Ted
4331,A dance to make it rain.,Barney
4332,Yes. <em>(Barney slaps him once again and Ted slaps him back. Barney tries again to slaps Ted but he stops him)</em> We're finding Penelope!,Ted
4333,"No, we are not!",Barney
4334,"Yes, we are!",Ted
4335,"Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!",Barney
4336,"Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship.",Barney
4337,Twice!,Barney
4338,Shh!,Barney
4339,"Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend.",Ted
4340,There's this girl...,Ted
4341,"Penelope, this is the girl I love. If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy. Please.",Ted
4342,Absolutely.,Ted
4343,Kind of.,Ted
4344,Hey.,Barney
4345,We weren't exclusive!,Barney
4346,"Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position.",Barney
4347,There's so much of your mom in you.,Barney
4348,And she's been throwing up ever since.,Robin
4349,"Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about? Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment with a string quartet and roses and chocolates...",Robin
4350,"Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy? I mean, a string quartet in my living room... who does that?",Robin
4351,Exactly.,Robin
4352,So you're saying you would forbid me from going?,Lily
4353,"Forbid? Who said forbid? I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months, and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day. Look for me... I'll be the guy in the awesome suit. Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted.",Marshall
4354,"Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them. I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever.",Lily
4355,So now we've gone from &quot;I was never gonna do it&quot; to &quot;I need to do this&quot;? Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?,Marshall
4356,"Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it.",Lily
4357,"I never said that! You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now, what's gonna change in three months? Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.",Marshall
4358,Maybe not.,Lily
4359,Pause.,Marshall
4360,"So, are you just, like, starving?",Lily
4361,Totally. Red Lobster?,Marshall
4362,"Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious!",Lily
4363,"Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it. Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you.",Marshall
4364,"I wouldn't dare. <em>(Marshall starts crying)</em> Marshall, no. We're on pause. There's no crying in Pauseland! Pauseland is a magical place, with... with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers! Damn it!",Lily
4365,"Ted, this is funny. Still funny. Still fu... And now it's sad.",Barney
4366,"Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?",Ted
4367,"Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance?",Ted
4368,"Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?",Ted
4369,No?,Ted
4370,Have you ever seen a rain dance?,Ted
4371,"Terrific. Uh, look, I should run. I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R. I can't believe this. We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves.",Ted
4372,"How did we get here? Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was, did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge.",Marshall
4373,I think there's still one left.,Lily
4374,Dibs.,Marshall
4375,Unpause?,Lily
4376,Unpause.,Marshall
4377,Look... I know this sucks. It's just something I'm going through. I'm not asking you to understand it. I'm not asking you to be happy about it. I'm just asking you to support it.,Lily
4378,"I want to, Lily, okay? I really do. But I just can't.",Marshall
4379,Why not?,Lily
4380,"Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not. What if you decide to go be a painter and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore, and three months becomes forever? Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?",Marshall
4381,Marshall...,Lily
4382,"'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now. I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out.",Marshall
4383,"Marshall, I love you.",Lily
4384,Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?,Marshall
4385,Pause.,Lily
4386,"No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore. Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?!",Marshall
4387,Pause!,Lily
4388,"Why do you want me to pause?! (<em>She throws herself on him et kisses him</em>) That's just a great use of the pause function, baby.",Marshall
4389,Thank you.,Lily
4390,"Hey, Ted. Whatcha doing?",Barney
4391,A rain dance.,Ted
4392,"Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.",Barney
4393,"Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour.",Ted
4394,These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl. This isn't gonna work!,Barney
4395,Yeah. I know that.,Ted
4396,"Well, then why are you doing this?",Barney
4397,"Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work. But it has to work! You hear me, universe? This is Ted Mosby talking! Give me some rain! Come on! Come on! Come on...!",Ted
4398,"Oh, come on!",Barney
4399,How about that? He did it.,Barney
4400,"Robin! Hey, Robin! <em>(Robin opens up her window)</em> Oh, thank God you're here!",Ted
4401,My camping trip got rained out.,Robin
4402,I know. I'm sorry.,Ted
4403,It's not your fault.,Robin
4404,"Yeah, it is. Come down here.",Ted
4405,It's pouring. You come up.,Robin
4406,"No, you have to come down here.",Ted
4407,Why?,Robin
4408,"Why? Because I made it rain, that's what I did today! And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!",Ted
4409,"I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up.",Robin
4410,"I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not. You have to come down here!",Ted
4411,I was gonna...,Robin
4412,I know.,Ted
4413,"OK, where was I? It was June 2006 and life had just taken an unexpected turn.",Ted
4414,"Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important. It's all part of the story.",Ted
4415,"No. The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful. For me, it started out great. <em>(In 2006, Ted and Robin are kissing after the rain dance)</em> In fact, day one was amazing. I'd finally gotten together with Robin. But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life, your Uncle Marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his <em>(Ted finds Marshall on their stairs, holding in his hand Lily's engagement ring).</em>",Ted
4416,So that's it? We're breaking up?,Marshall
4417,"Marshall, I'm sorry. I just... I just need to go to San Francisco and do this art program and figure out who I am outside of us. And the only way that I can do that is if we don't talk for a while.",Lily
4418,"For a while? Try never, OK? You walk out that door and we're done. You're never gonna hear my voice again.",Marshall
4419,I should call her.,Marshall
4420,"No! No! If you call her, when she asked you not to, you're just gonna look weak and you're gonna regret it. Now, listen. Whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first... and I will punch you in the face.",Ted
4421,You're a good friend Ted.,Marshall
4422,"Hey! So, did you hear the big news?",Robin
4423,"You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up and Lily is gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night? Yeah, I think he knows.",Ted
4424,Oh my god! I... I'm so sorry. What happened?,Robin
4425,"Well, she left. And I don't even know if she's coming back.",Marshall
4426,"I didn't get your message until I woke up. Bro, I am so sorry.",Barney
4427,Thanks.,Marshall
4428,I know it must be tough. But are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better but will actively excite you?,Barney
4429,Sure.,Marshall
4430,"For the first time ever, the three of us are single at the same time. I've dreamed about this day boys and it's going to be legendary! Together, we will own this city. Any time, a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriend, we'll be there. Any time a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge-drinking, we will be there. Any time a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo sticking their heads out, shouting &quot;What's up New York?&quot; we will be what is up New York! Gentlemen, we are about to embark on... <em>(While he's speaking, Barney looks at Ted and then at Robin).</em> Oh man, you guys did it, didn't you?!",Barney
4431,Hey Marshall.,Ted
4432,Hey Ted.,Marshall
4433,Are you hungry?,Ted
4434,"What's the point? I could it some food, it's just gonna leave me.",Marshall
4435,"At least in that scenario, you get to do the dumping. Come on, it's Sunday, it's pancakes day!",Ted
4436,"Lily always made the pancakes. God, I loved her pancakes. So soft. So warmed. So perfectly shaped.",Marshall
4437,"Are we still talking about her pancakes? Come on, you gotta eat something. What can I get you?",Ted
4438,Beer.,Marshall
4439,"No, that's what you had for dinner.",Ted
4440,Fine. Than I'll just have the leftover,Marshall
4441,"So he stays home all the time not getting laid? No, see, that's what you do when you have a fiancÃ©e. He should be down here celebrating. He's free. He got that red-head-tumor removed.",Barney
4442,You should write and illustrate children's books.,Ted
4443,"You know what Marshall needs to do? He needs to stop being sad. When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story.",Barney
4444,"It's only been a month. He just needs to goat his own pace. Anyway, lily is the one who caused this whole mess.",Ted
4445,"Hey, cut her some slack! She's our friend too. She's just trying to figure out who she is.",Robin
4446,"Figure out who she is? She should call me. I got a whole list. She's selfish, she's immature, she's...",Ted
4447,What?,Robin
4448,"God, your eyes are so blue.",Ted
4449,"Teddy bear... <em>(They kiss, Barney mimes his death with a sword. Ted and Robin look at him and keep kissing)</em>",Robin
4450,"So, I find her shampoo. I guess she left it here. It smells like her. Like lavender and seashells. Hope. Somehow erotic and comforting all at the same time.",Marshall
4451,That's my shampoo.,Robin
4452,Oh. Sorry.,Marshall
4453,I thought he's never go to sleep.,Robin
4454,Uh-oh.,Ted
4455,Already?,Robin
4456,He's calling her. Dammit!,Ted
4457,I don't hear anyth...Ted <em>(going out of the bedroom)</em>: He's calling her! <em>(Tackling Marshall)</em> Argh!,Robin
4458,"Oh! OK, you're right. I won't call her. I will not call her.",Marshall
4459,"Well, I called her. And get this, she changed her number. Well like I'm gonna stalk her or something? Like she's so special?! Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there? 'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her, based on the brief conversations I had with them!",Marshall
4460,"Yeah. Hey Robin. Anyway, one of the Lily Adrins...",Marshall
4461,"This has to stop! Ted, we just started dating. We agreed we don't wanna move too fast and yet somehow we have a baby. He can't feed himself, he cries a lot, he keeps us up all night...",Robin
4462,Have you tried breast-feeding? Nailed it!,Barney
4463,They were together nine years. It's only been a month and a half. He just needs to go his own pace.,Ted
4464,He slept on our floor last night Ted.,Robin
4465,He watched a scary movie.,Ted
4466,It is time for some tough love. We need to get him out of that apartment. He needs fresh air. He needs sunshine.,Robin
4467,Mmm. Sunshine.,Barney
4468,"Barney, I really don't think this is gonna help.",Marshall
4469,"Do you know why you're not over Lily yet? It's 'cause you can still picture her naked. You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs. It's a scientific fact. The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images, or BPEGs and your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's.",Barney
4470,There are a lot of them.,Marshall
4471,"They won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs. Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs so we begin here tonight my friend. Two at the time. Those count as four.",Barney
4472,"Yeah, this is fun, right? We're outside, it's a beautiful day. The Indians are winning!",Ted
4473,"I gotta admit, it is really nice to be outside.",Marshall
4474,"Oh, no. <em>(A man is proposing to his girlfriend. Marshall stands up and throws a hotdog at the engaged couple.)</em>",Ted
4475,"It's all a big lie! She's just gonna break your heart! (Men drag Marshall out of the stadium) You can drag me outta here, but she has no soul!",Marshall
4476,"We've tried everything. Baseball, strippers. The guy still won't eat a damn pancake. I think he's beyond repair.",Ted
4477,"See, this is the problem with guys, you don't know how to deal with heartbreak.",Robin
4478,"So what's your prescription, Dr Oestrogen? Eat H&amp;auml;agen-Dazs and Watch Love actually until your periods sync up? <em>(Ted and Barney laugh)</em>",Barney
4479,"Yeah, that's the stuff.",Robin
4480,Oh my God! How long have you been doing this?,Marshall
4481,"My Dad taught me to sh**t when I was a kid. Now, whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here and it reminds me that... g*n are fun!",Robin
4482,"Um, you know, Ted is kinda against g*n.Robin <em>(turning to Marshall, her g*n still in her hand)</em>: That's why Ted never gonna find out about this. Whoa! That sort of got scary with me holding a g*n, didn't it? No, I just mean, please don't tell Ted. You wanna try?",Marshall
4483,"Only hell, yes. Oh yeah, yeah. This is what I needed. I felt so powerless this whole time but this... This is power, this is... <em>(He sh**t and falls down)</em>",Marshall
4484,I should have mention the recoil.,Robin
4485,"I'll hand it to you. When he got home, Marshall was smiling. Did you sleep with him? 'Cause I was actually like three days away from suggesting that.",Ted
4486,"Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side. <em>(We see Marshall sh**ting and laughing maniacally )</em>",Robin
4487,"Well, congratulations. You're the first person to cheer him up all summer. You win.",Ted
4488,Oh! What do I win?,Robin
4489,I'll tell what you win. I'm taking you away this weekend.,Ted
4490,You are? That's so nice!,Robin
4491,"My aunt and uncle have a beach house at Montauk. It's really romantic. My uncle had, like, three affairs there.",Ted
4492,"Wow, it must be a nice house. I saw pictures of your uncle. This is so great. We'll finally get some time alone. Are you sure Marshall is gonna be OK with this?",Robin
4493,"Yeah sure. Absolutely. Dude, I'm doing much better. In fact, take my car.",Marshall
4494,"Really? Hey, thanks. And hey, if you need anything, day or night, just call me. You know what? Please don't call me. What? What's wrong?",Ted
4495,It's Lily's credit card bill. She must have forgotten to switch her address.,Marshall
4496,So?,Ted
4497,I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there.,Marshall
4498,"No, no. No good can come from looking at this. You've made too much progress already.",Ted
4499,"I know, but I just...",Marshall
4500,"August 5, one charge - tickets. To what? George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars. August 10, one charge, Tennis Emporium. August 18, two charges. Mario's bistro and - get this - Pet Palace. You guys see what it means right?",Marshall
4501,"Wow, Mario's bistro. What a perfect place to whore around.",Lily
4502,"Oh funk legend George Clinton, I am so glad you spotted me at your concert an drag me on stage to dance with you Courteney Cox style.",Lily
4503,"Oh you know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years but I didn't do it because I never truly loved him.",Lily
4504,"Oh! A ferret. I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace. I've always wanted one, but Marshall have this secret phobia of ferrets.",Lily
4505,"It was! Oh, I love you funk legend George Clinton.",Lily
4506,That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.,Ted
4507,"Yeah. Why are you afraid of ferrets, they are adorable.",Robin
4508,"Because, Robin, they are like fuzzy tube-shaped rats.",Marshall
4509,Those charges are from a month ago.,Barney
4510,Exactly!,Ted
4511,"For new charges, you have to go to her online account. You can see credit card activity from like two hours ago. But... You know... Don't... <em>(Marshall leaves the bar, running).</em>",Barney
4512,Why do you talk? Why do you talk?,Ted
4513,"He needs her password. Its not like he has her password. Ooh, he has her password. This is... He has her password.",Barney
4514,"There is a charge from earlier today. The Kellet Hotel, on Fifth. I don't believe this. Lily is back in New-York. (...) I can't believe this. Lily's in New-York? I guess I'd been thinking when she got back she's call me. That's the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.",Marshall
4515,"OK, you know what? I'm calling her.",Marshall
4516,"No! You're not calling her. This changes nothing. <em>(To Barney)</em> You, come here. <em>(Barney and Robin follow Ted in the kitchen).</em> While we're away this weekend can you keep an eye on him? Make sure he doesn't call her hotel.",Ted
4517,You want me to baby-sit him? 20 bucks. An hour. And money for pizza.,Barney
4518,Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this. <em>(To Robin)</em> Come here my little baby. <em>(Ted and Robin are making out)</em>,Ted
4519,"OK, I'll do it! Stop being a couple.",Barney
4520,Marshall!,Robin
4521,Marshall! Marshall!,Ted
4522,"Ted, I know I shouldn't do this but I have to!",Marshall
4523,Everything we've worked so hard for...!,Ted
4524,"Hello, Lily Aldrin's room please. Thank you.",Marshall
4525,Hang up now!,Ted
4526,"Ted, I can't hang up now.",Marshall
4527,Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up!,Ted
4528,Hello?! <em>(He hangs up)</em> A guy answered. There is... There is a guy in her room. I'm going down there.,Marshall
4529,No!,Barney
4530,"Dude, you can't...",Ted
4531,I have to go down there and I have to tell her I love her. I have to beg to take me back even if I have to tell on my knees.,Marshall
4532,"Marshall, you can't do that!",Robin
4533,Really? Why not?,Marshall
4534,"Because you're pathetic! I'm sorry. But right now, you are not Marshall. You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a sh*t in hell with a girl like Lily. You know who might have a sh*t somewhere down the line? Marshall. The real Marshall. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car?",Ted
4535,Bold. Bold to go for the car.,Barney
4536,What?,Ted
4537,I didn't say a thing.,Robin
4538,You think I was too hard on him.,Ted
4539,I didn't say a thing.,Robin
4540,I can't believe you're accusing me to be too hard on him. You're the one who said tough love.,Ted
4541,"Yeah, tough love, not hand the guy a noose.",Robin
4542,"Oh, but it's OK to hand him a 9 mm? Yeah. He told me. So you're a g*n nut?",Ted
4543,"No, I'm a g*n enthusiast.",Robin
4544,Do you know how many people are k*ll...,Ted
4545,The Second Amendment protects my right to bear arms...,Robin
4546,"Alright, alright. I was too hard on him.",Ted
4547,A little.,Robin
4548,"I'm gonna call Barney, see how they're doing.",Ted
4549,Barney.,Barney
4550,"Uh, hey. Where are you guys?",Ted
4551,We're at a fundraiser helping young women raise money for college.,Barney
4552,Strip-club. Nice. Is Marshall OK?,Ted
4553,"Yeah, he's here and he's great. Hang on. Marshall, tell Ted... Uh-oh.",Barney
4554,What? What uh-oh?,Ted
4555,He's gone.,Barney
4556,You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel.,Ted
4557,"Crap, you're right. OK, here is the plan. Here is the plan. You go down to the hotel and find him. I'll stay here and get a lap dance. Bye Ted!",Barney
4558,Barney!<em>[End of the phone call]</em>,Ted
4559,Is there a hot tube at your uncle's place?,Robin
4560,A really nice one.,Ted
4561,"Hi. Uh, could you tell me what room Lily Aldrin's in? Thanks. Marshall!",Ted
4562,Hey.,Marshall
4563,What happened?,Ted
4564,"Well, I went up to Lily's floor...",Marshall
4565,"...and I had this little speech in my head. Everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect. I knocked on the door. <em>(A man is opening the door and Marshall is punching him in the face).",Marshall
4566,You knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?,Ted
4567,Yeah. It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.,Marshall
4568,What? Who was he?,Ted
4569,"Oh, this is so embarrassing. I could've sworn I have some change. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Oh, here we go. No that's, that's a button... It was a button. Do you take credit cards?",Lily
4570,"So Lily is not back in town and she doesn't have a boyfriend. That's good news, right?",Ted
4571,Yeah. I don't know. Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her. I don't know where she is or what she's doing. She was my whole life man and now she's... She's gone.,Marshall
4572,"You know, first day at college, I showed up, I was so freaked out and I got up to my room and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall. He had headphones on, a big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap. Happy. Confident. Not afraid of anything. That guy was you. You before you met Lily.",Ted
4573,Ted.,Marshall
4574,Yeah.,Ted
4575,I was high that day. I was. I was so high I thought you were the dean.,Marshall
4576,"What I'm saying is, there's a version of you without Lily and... It's not this. You can't let Lily stole your identity the way that guy stole hers.",Ted
4577,"OK.OK! Resolved. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being OK. Cheers.",Marshall
4578,Cheers.,Ted
4579,Ted. Ted you should see this.,Robin
4580,"Oh, what now? Marshall? What are you doing?",Ted
4581,It's Sunday. It's pancakes day.,Marshall
4582,"Alright, see you guys later.",Robin
4583,I'll walk you out.,Ted
4584,See ya.,Marshall
4585,You just checked out Robin's ass.,Barney
4586,"What? No. I... Barney, I was...",Marshall
4587,"Dude, that's awesome! You're finally forgetting about that short redhead.",Barney
4588,Lily.,Marshall
4589,"Yes, Lily, thank you. That was gonna drive me crazy all night. Hey, Ted! Marshall's just checked out your girlfriend's ass.",Barney
4590,I did not Ted...,Marshall
4591,Awesome! You're finally getting better.,Ted
4592,"This is the moment I've been waiting for. Starting tonight, I'm gonna teach you how to live. Ted, you're out of chance, Marshall's in.",Barney
4593,Yes!,Ted
4594,"Oh, God!",Marshall
4595,"Marshall, being a single guy in New York city is like... Pfff... What does everybody like?",Barney
4596,Candy.,Marshall
4597,Yeah! It's like being in a candy store. You just walk right in and grab yourself some Whoppers. Yeah. Is Whoppers the best ones?,Barney
4598,Mounds.,Ted
4599,Milk Duds.,Barney
4600,Gobstoppers.,Ted
4601,Um...,Barney
4602,Dubble Bubbles.,Ted
4603,"Nice! Marshall, we're doing this. I am not taking no for an answer.",Barney
4604,Fine.,Marshall
4605,"Ted, what is wrong with you?",Marshall
4606,Lily.,Robin
4607,It is a great ass.,Lily
4608,Your hair is adorable!,Robin
4609,Thank you! <em>(They hug)</em>,Lily
4610,Hi. Have you met Marshall?,Barney
4611,"Hi. Look how sweaty my hands are! It's weird, right? Uh, sweat. Like this... Smelly water coming out of your skin. It was nice meeting you.",Marshall
4612,"I-I-I Hate to interrupt but, uh... Do you like magic?",Barney
4613,"Dude, you were awesome last night. You were charming, you were funny. You were totally working that girl.",Barney
4614,You went home with her!,Marshall
4615,"Yes, I did. But she told me that if it wasn't for me you would've had a sh*t with her. So in hypothetical terms, you scored last night! All right! Hypothetical high five! Nice! Tonight, we're gonna go to the bar...",Barney
4616,"Barney, no, I'm not going out with you ever again.",Marshall
4617,Come on! I'll teach you all my strategies!,Barney
4618,"Oh, really?",Marshall
4619,"My favorite, number seven. Create a mystery about yourself. That way, they become so intrigued that they have to hang out with you all night.",Barney
4620,"Oh, come on. Does that really work?",Marshall
4621,Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't.,Barney
4622,"Dammit that's intriguing! OK, I'm in.",Marshall
4623,You've gotta hear this.,Robin
4624,You will not believe what just happened.,Ted
4625,You go first.,Robin
4626,I find a 1939 penny on the subway. Just imagine the history this little copper guy's seen...,Ted
4627,Lily is back in town.,Robin
4628,And you let me go first?! Have you seen her?,Ted
4629,"Uh, yeah. I actually went apartment hunting with her today.",Robin
4630,How is she doing?,Ted
4631,You're not gonna like it.,Robin
4632,"I am doing great. This summer, best thing ever. San Francisco is so happening right now.",Lily
4633,She's happy? Marshall had the worst summer of his life and she's happy. And I suppose her art program was fulfilling or whatever.,Ted
4634,"Oh, the art program, best thing ever.",Lily
4635,"But the best part of SF - oh that's what we call San Francisco - the people. Even just riding around on the bus all summer, it was like a human tapestry.",Lily
4636,"Wow, I am so happy for you.",Robin
4637,"Oh, she's such a... godda... God! After what she did to Marshall, she should come back here devastated. Crawling over the broken glass of her own shame and regret.",Ted
4638,You never chose sides. I respect that.,Robin
4639,She's unbelievable! Unbelievable!,Ted
4640,Unbelievable? What's unbelievable?,Marshall
4641,"Uh, listen Marshall...",Ted
4642,Ted found a penny on the subway and it's old and that's interesting.,Robin
4643,Way to go.,Marshall
4644,"OK, first of all, that is interesting. Second, we have to tell him.",Ted
4645,"No, we don't. He's just starting to get better. Going out with Barney. How do you think he'll feel when he hears Lily's moved on?",Robin
4646,She's moved on?,Ted
4647,"Well, it happens. I've fallen out of love faster than that before. Sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever. One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me. But we're great! Honey?",Robin
4648,Let's review Barney's rules for mating without dating. Lesson two: corollary five.,Barney
4649,Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive and she'll be putty in your hands.,Marshall
4650,Excellent. Have you chosen your entrÃ©e?,Barney
4651,"I have. A sweet brunette, eight o'clock. Nine o'clock. Ten; thirty. She's walking to the bar.",Marshall
4652,"Her? Really? No, you're right. Ambition is the enemy of success. OK, hit it.",Barney
4653,Nice recovery. I think it's working.,Barney
4654,"Um, Amy, this is my friend Barney. Barney, this is Amy.",Marshall
4655,"Hi. Amy, do you like... magic?",Barney
4656,I hate you.,Marshall
4657,I am so sorry. It's a sickness. I'm the real v*ctim here.,Barney
4658,Twice! Twice in a row you took my candy! That was my candy!,Marshall
4659,I know but tonight...,Barney
4660,"No, forget it. You're such a jackass!",Marshall
4661,"OK, but no magic. <em>(He turns to Barney who disappeared).</em> How did you do that?",Marshall
4662,"I'm taking a leak, dumb-ass.",Barney
4663,"But I need the freedom to really chase my passion, which was painting but now, I think it's music, or spoken words. Maybe both. God, isn't life amazing.",Lily
4664,Yeah.,Ted
4665,It is so great to see you Ted. Ah! I'm gonna get the key for the lockbox.,Lily
4666,What?,Robin
4667,"She's miserable. She's realized she's made a huge mistake. Her and Marshall will be back together in a week, I love it!",Ted
4668,"No, you just want Lily to be miserable. The truth is she's happy.",Robin
4669,Trust me. I've known Lily for nine years.,Ted
4670,"Trust me, I'm a girl!",Robin
4671,Yeah. But you're Canadian.,Ted
4672,Why do you always have to bring that up?,Robin
4673,You're our weird neighbors!,Ted
4674,You bring it up every time...,Robin
4675,"No, alright. Five bucks says she still wants Marshall.",Ted
4676,You're on.,Robin
4677,Five American bucks.,Ted
4678,"Dammit! OK, so how do we get the truth out of her?",Robin
4679,"Tequila. It's her weakness. Three shots, she tells you the truth about anything.",Ted
4680,"Marshall Eriksen, suit up!",Barney
4681,No way.,Marshall
4682,Yeah you're good in that. Let's go.,Barney
4683,Wait. Empty your pockets. Come on.,Marshall
4684,Come on...,Barney
4685,Sleeves.,Marshall
4686,There is nothing in my sl...,Barney
4687,Oh is that right?,Marshall
4688,Huh? Huh? Let's go.,Barney
4689,Behind my ear.,Marshall
4690,Oh there is nothing behind your... Ohh!,Barney
4691,Ohh!,Marshall
4692,"Oh, tell me about it. I'm a third year at Columbia Law, so... If the workload does k*ll you I can probably get a conviction. Yeah.",Marshall
4693,"Yes, it would. It really would.",Marshall
4694,"Probably not. I'm never here, so...",Marshall
4695,Great. Nice.,Marshall
4696,"Hi, I'm Barney.",Barney
4697,"Oh, no.",Marshall
4698,Do you mind giving my friend your phone number?,Barney
4699,"Whoo! I did it! I got a girl's phone number! Oh, and her handwriting is so cute. Look. I'll take her out for Chinese food and then we'll walk through the park. It'll be so... What?",Marshall
4700,"Sorry buddy, I'm taking this one too.",Barney
4701,"And then I discovered this area, North beach. Best beach ever! Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer. How are you guys doing? And hey, how is Marshall?",Lily
4702,Gimme the card! I swear I'm gonna...,Marshall
4703,I'm not giving you...,Barney
4704,Terrific.,Ted
4705,"That is so good to hear. <em>(Lily's phone rings).</em> Oh, hold on. This could be about he apartment. <em>(She leaves the room).</em>",Lily
4706,"OK, we're way past truth-telling Lily and about to hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998 Lily, and I'm not cleaning that up again. So, congratulations. You win, she's happy.",Ted
4707,I didn't get it. That first apartment. I... I waited too long and somebody else got it. <em>(She starts crying).</em>,Lily
4708,"Interesting. Wow Lily, you, uh, seem to be having a pretty strong reaction to losing this apartment. I wonder is it because it reminds you of something you lost because you couldn't commit?",Ted
4709,"No, Lily you're crying over the crown moulding and the real hardwood floor. There's no deeper meaning, right Lily? Just quit crying and tell him.",Robin
4710,The apartment is a metaphor for Marshall! <em>(Robin gives back Ted his five dollars)</em>,Lily
4711,Stop it!,Barney
4712,You don't want to see me when I'm angry!,Marshall
4713,"Stop! If we can't settle this like gentlemen, then no one gets the number. <em>(He sends the card across the window).</em>",Barney
4714,Stop the cab! <em>(Marshall gets out of the car)</em>,Marshall
4715,"No, wait. Come on. Wait. Marshall! 81st and 1st please. <em>(He pulls the card out of his sleeve)</em>. Oh, she does have a cute handwriting.",Barney
4716,"Shhh! Bring me the dirtiest, greasiest tuna melt you got. And a milkshake.",Lily
4717,Gravy.,Ted
4718,Surprise me.,Ted
4719,I'd take you with gravy if my boyfriend wasn't sitting right here! Just kidding. I'm good.,Robin
4720,What are you charpy about?,Lily
4721,She's still drunk from last night.,Ted
4722,I don't think so! Whoo!,Robin
4723,"Look, if you want Marshall back so bad, how come it took you two days to ask about him?",Ted
4724,I was dying to ask. I was just trying to play it cool. But really...,Lily
4725,"But it's good, I mean work's great...",Robin
4726,"Say something about Marshall. Where is Marshall? How's Marshall? What's Marshall doing right now? <em>(They are now with Ted in an other building)</em> Shut up and talk about Marshall. Shut up and talk about Marshall! Shut up and talk about Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Aaah I gotta ask! <em>(Then, the three of them are in Robin's apartment)</em> And, hey, how is Marshall?",Lily
4727,It was such an awful summer! I just wanted to get back here and see him.,Lily
4728,But I thought your summer was great?!,Ted
4729,Not exactly...,Lily
4730,So all those interesting people you met on the bus...?,Ted
4731,"Yeah, um...",Lily
4732,"I never got in touch because I was too embarrassed. I screwed everything up. I have no job, no place to live. I lost the love of my life. Look, I know I have no right to ask this but do you think Marshall would take me back?",Lily
4733,"In a b*at. If you called him up, yeah, he'd take you back with open arms.",Ted
4734,"Wow. So, maybe I should call him?",Lily
4735,"Maybe. No! This is... Ooww... Hold on. Look. If you're gonna go back to him, I don't wanna hear the word &quot;maybe&quot;. &quot;Maybe&quot; cannot be in your vocabulary. This break-up almost k*ll him. And he cannot go through it again. So, unless you're absolutely certain, stay the hell away from him.",Ted
4736,Hi Marshall.,Barney
4737,"No, go away, I don't want to talk to you.",Marshall
4738,"OK. I know what I did a couple nights back was is in a moral grey area. But the great news is she loved you. If things had gone your way, you'd gone out a couple time, I think she definitely would've had sex with you.",Barney
4739,"There is no &quot;would&quot; in sex. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it.",Marshall
4740,"You can't give up now. What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes, only this time you get her and I don't.",Barney
4741,That's not possible.,Marshall
4742,"Oh, but it is. She has... Wait for it. Here it comes. Almost there...an identical twin. Yes!",Barney
4743,A twin isn't the same person.,Marshall
4744,"Of course, it is. What do you think &quot;identical&quot; means? &quot;Ident-&quot; - same. &quot;-ical&quot; - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date.",Barney
4745,Fine.,Marshall
4746,Ah!,Barney
4747,"But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin.",Marshall
4748,Used-up? They're a human being Marshall.,Barney
4749,How are you doing?,Barney
4750,Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking.,Marshall
4751,"You are. You definitely are. Listen, you're gonna have to leave now. I just talked with the twins and, get this, I'm going home with both of them! Yeah. That's happening.",Barney
4752,It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.,Marshall
4753,But they're twins.,Barney
4754,You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.,Marshall
4755,"Well, it's not like a candy store. It's a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. I may be your best friend...",Barney
4756,Ted's my best friend.,Marshall
4757,"...but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is. And after nine years of captivity, that is the single greatest lesson I can teach you about surviving in the wild. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have two unique breasts an two duplicates waiting for me. <em>(Barney rejoins the twins, Marshall leaves the bar).</em> Oh bad news. Marshall got food poisoning.",Barney
4758,Yeah. I guess we're just a threesome tonight.,Barney
4759,Lily. What are you doing here?,Marshall
4760,"Oh, I-I was just walking by. I wasn't... Oh, you mean, New-York? My program ended. It was just great. Just lots of fun. It was awful. It was the worst mistake I ever made. I'm so sorry Marshall. And, hello.",Lily
4761,"Lily, this was the worst summer of my life.",Marshall
4762,I know. It was the worst summer of my life.,Lily
4763,It was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through.,Marshall
4764,Can we please get back together?,Lily
4765,"All that crap you said to me about &quot;we need to figure out who we are outside of us, and we need to learn to do things on our own.&quot;. It broke my heart. Three months ago, you broke my heart.",Marshall
4766,Can we please get back together?,Lily
4767,"Lily, you were right. All that crap was right. So, no. No, we can't get back together. We shouldn't. At least, not right now.",Marshall
4768,Wow. OK. Yeah. Wi... Will we still see each other?,Lily
4769,Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I don't know. This is all really new to me. I just got out of a long relationship. I like your hair.,Marshall
4770,"Thanks. I, uh, figured, new city, new color - uh, old color. <em>(Music 'It's gonna be different this time' / Later).</em> And the pizza there. Worst pizza ever! I'm so glad to be back in New-York.",Lily
4771,Yeah.,Marshall
4772,"Listen, if there is anything I can do to even begin to make things up to you.",Lily
4773,"Actually, there's maybe something you can do for me. But you can never ever ask me why.",Marshall
4774,"So then, I was promoted to assistant mÃ©nage-er. Manager. Why do I keep doing that? <em>(Lily arrives.)</em> Lily?",Barney
4775,"You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk! <em>(She throws a drink at his face and leaves)</em>",Lily
4776,"So, where was I? Ah yes. Assistant mÃ©nage-er. I did it again. I can't believe it!",Barney
4777,"You gave my twin sister Chlamydia! You slime! <em>(She throws a second drink at his face and leaves, following by the twins).</em>",Lily
4778,"Wait, wait, I know magic. Well played, Eriksen.

4780,I wish your face would melt off.,Lily
4781,I wish your eyeballs would explode.,Marshall
4782,I hate you.,Lily
4783,I hate you more.,Marshall

4785,I can't say I blame you.,Barney
4786,"No, I mean I'm seriously going to k*ll him.",Ted
4787,I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.,Robin
4788,"Okay, if you don't, I will.",Robin
4789,You mean the spa the judge ordered him to go to to quit cocaine?,Ted
4790,"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.",Lily
4791,Good to see you.,Marshall
4792,I was just stopping by to pick up some of my things.,Lily
4793,Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?,Marshall
4794,Me begging Marshall to take me back and him rejecting me?,Lily
4795,"Actually, we're cool. We just divided up CDs. It was all very civil. I'm proud of us. Wwe're, we're good.",Marshall
4796,What?,Marshall
4797,"Well, I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable.",Lily
4798,Why would it?,Marshall
4799,"Well, I mean, yeah, we're... We're good, but you got to admit there's that stuff between us.",Lily
4800,"Um, not for me. Now it's just like we're friends. It's like we're brother and sister.",Marshall
4801,"&quot;Brother and sister&quot;?! Okay. Fine, yeah, I'll see you at the restaurant, bro. <em>(She leaves)</em>",Lily
4802,"Hello, everyone.",Lily
4803,"Hello, Marshall.",Lily
4804,"Oh, thanks. It's kind of revealing, but I thought, &quot;Hey, we're all family.&quot; Right, bro? Ooh, ah...",Lily
4805,What's wrong?,Ted
4806,"Oh, I, I hurt my ankle in yoga today. The instructor told me to just take deep breaths to get through the pain, just... <em>(She breathes deeply while Marshall glances at her low neckline)</em> Are you all right? You're kind of sweating.",Lily
4807,"No, I'm fine. It's just... This roll is really spicy.",Marshall
4808,"Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to torture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too.",Marshall
4809,"Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch.",Barney
4810,"No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves.",Marshall
4811,That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.,Barney
4812,"Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs.",Marshall
4813,I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.,Barney
4814,Hello.,Marshall
4815,"Hey, Marshall.",Ted
4816,Hey.,Robin
4817,Hey. How are you feeling? You looked kind of feverish last night.,Lily
4818,"Oh, no, I actually feel great. It is kind of warm in here, though, isn't it?",Marshall
4819,"Oh, I don't know, if anything, it's kind of... (<em>Marshall starts unzipping his knee zips)</em> What are you doing?",Lily
4820,"Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just making myself feel a little bit more... comfortable. <em>(He starts massaging his calve)</em> Oh. Oh, yes. I've been doing all these toe lifts lately, and so... My calves have really been cramping up.",Marshall
4821,Take off your dress.,Marshall
4822,Take off the rest of your pants.,Lily
4823,I really wasn't expecting that to happen.,Lily
4824,"Yeah, me neither. It kind of complicates things, doesn't it?",Marshall
4825,"Yeah, it does. Why did you have to throw your magnificent calves at me? You know you have a punter's leg.",Lily
4826,"Well, why did you have to throw your beautiful boobs at me? You know you have... boobs.",Marshall
4827,"Just admit it, you came here trying to seduce me.",Lily
4828,Seduce you? You seduced me.,Marshall
4829,You sat down next to me and took most of your pants off.,Lily
4830,You went to San Francisco for three months.,Marshall
4831,How is that seducing you?,Lily
4832,"Well, it's not but I'm still mad about it.",Marshall
4833,"All right, that's it - I want The b*at Anthology.",Lily
4834,"Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm keeping it! And you know the U2 box set I gave you? Look inside - all Dave Matthews.",Marshall
4835,You are evil.,Lily
4836,I'm going to k*ll him.,Ted
4837,I can't say I blame you.,Barney
4838,"No, I mean I'm seriously going to k*ll him.",Ted
4839,"Barney, what are you doing here?",Ted
4840,Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them.,Barney
4841,I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories.,Ted
4842,What?,Barney
4843,"Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about&#058; baseball.",Ted
4844,But I'm your best friend.,Barney
4845,"Well, actually Marshall's my...",Ted
4846,I'm the most important person in your life.,Barney
4847,"Well, Robin's actually...",Ted
4848,How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful.,Barney
4849,"To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have.",Robin
4850,"Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today.",Barney
4851,"Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.",Ted
4852,I know you've all been excited to meet...,Ted
4853,Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you. That needlepoint &quot;Bless This Mess&quot; pillow you made for Ted - what a stitch. Stitch! Did that just happen? <em>(Ted's parents and Barney laugh)</em>,Barney
4854,"Uh, Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend, Robin.",Ted
4855,Hello.,Robin
4856,"That's funny, I didn't even &quot;look&quot; in the mirror today. That's not anything, is it? So, I made a reservation at San Marino tonight for 8:00.",Robin
4857,I know.,Barney
4858,How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.,Robin
4859,"Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because...",Barney
4860,"Stop it! Don't, don't!",Ted
4861,"Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin?",Barney
4862,"What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass.",Robin
4863,"Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five!",Barney
4864,"Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it.",Barney
4865,"No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening.",Barney
4866,"Whoops. I think I dropped an ice cube down here. Ow, it's so cold.",Lily
4867,"All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute.",Marshall
4868,Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's?,Barney
4869,"No, I'm kind of tired.",Robin
4870,"Me, too.",Lily
4871,"Yeah, I'm sure my folks are gonna want...",Ted
4872,Cervezas? Did he fall?,Ted
4873,"St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m., it's my favorite service.",Barney
4874,Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?,Ted
4875,I'll save you a seat.,Barney
4876,Robin.,Robin
4877,"Susan, her name is Virginia.",Barney
4878,"Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now.",Barney
4879,Why?,Ted
4880,"Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?",Barney
4881,"Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry.",Barney
4882,I'm... oh. <em>(They hug).</em>,Barney
4883,"My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool?",Ted
4884,"I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom.",Barney
4885,Sure.,Ted
4886,"Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back...",Barney
4887,"Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God!",Ted
4888,I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?,Barney
4889,"My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible.",Ted
4890,"Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side.",Barney
4891,"Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use &quot;83%&quot;?",Ted
4892,"You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people at www.swingers.open-marriage-is-natural-legalize-polygamy.org have, and they beg to differ.",Barney
4893,That's not a real Web site.,Ted
4894,"Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real T-shirt for running in their 10K.",Barney
4895,"Hi, Dad.",Ted
4896,Enjoying your vacation so far?,Ted
4897,"Uh, listen, can I speak to you outside for a sec?",Ted
4898,So you went out with Barney last night?,Ted
4899,You have a good time?,Ted
4900,Yeah. So...,Ted
4901,Well...,Ted
4902,You think Cerrano's got a sh*t at the RBI title?,Ted
4903,"I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't. I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about-anything-uncomfortable gene",Ted
4904,"Well, you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene, that's for sure.",Barney
4905,I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.,Robin
4906,"Okay, if you don't, I will.",Robin
4907,One last thing about my mom. She grills every single one of my girlfriends about when we're gonna get married and have kids.,Ted
4908,But this is the first time she's meeting me.,Robin
4909,Doesn't matter. And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin Stacy: six kids in five years. The woman's basically a ride at a water park.,Ted
4910,But I don't want to get married and have kids. What am I supposed to say?,Robin
4911,You know what? You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions. You shouldn't have to apologize for them.,Ted
4912,I'm gonna lie.,Robin
4913,I would.,Ted
4914,Thanks again for letting me have the U2 box set.,Lily
4915,I know how important it is to you.,Marshall
4916,"Oh, good for her.",Ted
4917,"Oh, boy.",Robin
4918,I'm just not ready.,Robin
4919,"Oh. Uh, I thought you, um... It's great.",Robin
4920,"Ooh, a piano!",Barney
4921,"You lucked out with my mom last night, huh? What a relief, right?",Ted
4922,"Oh, absolutely. Whew, what a relief it is to know I'm the one girlfriend your mom doesn't want you to have kids with.",Robin
4923,Hooray?,Ted
4924,"I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl would pop out attractive children? 'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry, that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman.",Robin
4925,"Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important.",Ted
4926,What happened to Marshall and Lily?,Barney
4927,They've been fighting lately. They're probably off somewhere going at it.,Ted
4928,"Well, if she's so sweet, maybe she should have Ted's babies.",Robin
4929,"Nothing. <em>(She leaves the table to go to the bathroom, the door is locked, she knocks.)</em>",Robin
4930,Just a minute.,Lily
4931,Maybe less.,Marshall
4932,Why don't you want me to have your grandkids?,Robin
4933,"No! I mean, I don't know. I just... I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids. And you should. I'm a genetic gold mine. No family history of diabetes or heart disease. Everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight. I had one schizophrenic uncle but even he had perfect vision. Which was unfortunate for the people around the bell tower he was in, but still he was a very fine man, and...",Robin
4934,Excuse me. Sorry. Didn't know that there was a line.,Marshall
4935,"Marshall, your zipper.",Lily
4936,"Why do you say that? I mean, you got married pretty young. That wasn't a mistake. Was it?",Robin
4937,I wish your face would melt off.,Lily
4938,I wish your eyeballs would explode.,Marshall
4939,I'm gonna k*ll him.,Ted
4940,"I don't care how unpleasant it is, you have to talk to him.",Robin
4941,"Okay, if you don't, I will.",Robin
4942,"Sweetheart? Sweetheart?! The only sweetheart in your life should be the woman you married 30 years ago, not the waitress at the bar last night and not this clumsy floozy! <em>(To the waitress)</em> I'm sorry, you're not a floozy. I'm upset, I don't know what I'm saying. But stay away from my dad.",Ted
4943,"Dad? You, uh, want to tell Mom what happened at the bar last night?",Ted
4944,Oh?,Ted
4945,"Serious talk? Mom, what...? He was kissing another woman. Don't you care?",Ted
4946,Mrs. Mosby?,Robin
4947,What do you mean you're divorced? Since when?,Ted
4948,"So ten months ago, you just up and decided to get divorced without telling me?",Ted
4949,How could you not tell me this?!,Ted
4950,So last Christmas...?,Ted
4951,I got you a tandem bike.,Ted
4952,Who the hell is Frank?!,Ted
4953,"Okay, my head's about to explode, and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles, so I am leaving. <em>(He leaves, following by his parents and Robin)</em>",Ted
4954,"You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that. Ooh, no line at the omelet station.",Barney
4955,Lily... I'm sorry that I said all those things.,Marshall
4956,"Me, too.",Lily
4957,I just find it really confusing to be around you right now.,Marshall
4958,It's the same for me. I think we're probably both better off trying to keep some distance for a while.,Lily
4959,"Yeah, I think you're right. Are you wearing a push-up bra?",Marshall
4960,Did you Mystic Tan your calves?,Lily
4961,I withdraw the question.,Marshall
4962,Thank you.,Ted
4963,"No, this is ridiculous! We have to start talking about stuff, and not just baseball.",Ted
4964,"Against the Red Sox? Boy, that's a big win. No. No. No. We're not gonna blow past this. I mean, I don't even know who you people. I don't even know how you met.",Ted
4965,No.,Ted
4966,"That's it? That's what passes for communication in our family? Man, when I have kids, and I tell them how I met their mother, I'm gonna tell them everything, the whole damn story.",Ted
4967,"I just, I don't... I don't understand. You seemed so happy. When I was growing up, you seemed so... What happened?",Ted
4968,So? Robin and I are like that. That doesn't mean anything.,Ted
4969,Robin and I have different views on families. We're not about to break up because of it.,Ted
4970,Wow.,Robin
4971,I know.,Ted
4972,They love me!,Robin
4973,"Good. Good, I think it'll be really good for the family. By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't returned my last couple calls.",Ted
4974,No. No.,Ted
4975,"Well, we just had our first fight.",Ted
4976,We had our first fight.,Robin
4977,"Oh, no, what'd you fight about? <em>(He puts his headphones on).</em>",Barney
4978,"A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building...",Ted
4979,It's this big skyscraper in Spokane. It'd be a huge project for his firm.,Robin
4980,"And if we don't get it, we could go under.",Ted
4981,"So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company.",Robin
4982,Yes.,Ted
4983,"Well, all skyscrapers kind of look like a...",Marshall
4984,"Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front.",Ted
4985,"Wow, so it's the whole package.",Marshall
4986,"Yeah, you did.",Barney
4987,Had to.,Marshall
4988,"Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft.",Barney
4989,"Yeah, you did.",Marshall
4990,Had to.,Barney
4991,"It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices.",Ted
4992,"Yeah, you did.",Marshall
4993,That wasn't one.,Ted
4994,"So you and Ted had your first fight. It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me.",Lily
4995,"Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm.",Robin
4996,"Ooh, two tragedies in one day.",Lily
4997,"The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done.",Robin
4998,Hey.,Ted
4999,Hey.,Robin
5000,How was your day?,Ted
5001,Good.,Robin
5002,"Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was?",Ted
5003,"No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight?",Robin
5004,"You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time.",Ted
5005,"Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter.",Robin
5006,Robin!,Lily
5007,What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster.,Robin
5008,You should work at a su1c1de hotline.,Lily
5009,And then it got ugly.,Robin
5010,"What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like <em>Die Hard</em>. But <em>Field of Dreams</em>? Once is more than enough.",Robin
5011,So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is <em>Field of Dreams</em>?,Ted
5012,It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid.,Robin
5013,"So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie.",Robin
5014,"Robin, he's upset because you wouldn't listen to him, not because you didn't like some movie.",Lily
5015,How do you not like Field of Dreams?!,Ted
5016,"Listening is the foundation of a relationship. And if he's really droning on, you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards. You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI.",Lily
5017,I guess I don't know how to do that.,Robin
5018,"Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober. That's what I tried to explain to the cop.",Lily
5019,"No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?",Robin
5020,What the hell comes before &quot;Q&quot;?,Lily
5021,"Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.",Ted
5022,"You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up.",Marshall
5023,"Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?",Barney
5024,"That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck.",Marshall
5025,"Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.",Barney
5026,"I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job.",Ted
5027,Your job's not boring.,Marshall
5028,Robin thinks so.,Ted
5029,"Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God.",Barney
5030,I love it when you quote Scripture.,Ted
5031,"I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.",Barney
5032,"Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.",Ted
5033,"That's 'cause you're always like... <em>(Dully)</em> &quot;Ted Mosby, architect&quot;. If it were me, I'd be like... <em>(Confidently)</em> &quot;Ted Mosby, architect&quot;. Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude.",Barney
5034,"Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. &quot;Ted Mosby, architect&quot;. Trust me.",Barney
5035,"Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that?",Ted
5036,Solid point. She did have hair of gold.,Ted
5037,Mm-hmm.,Ted
5038,"Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?",Robin
5039,Yes.,Lily
5040,"Carl, do you really want to be with a woman who would trade sex for beer?",Lily
5041,Thanks.,Lily
5042,I wonder where Ted went.,Robin
5043,"Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier.",Robin
5044,"Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess.",Ted
5045,"Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to. Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right?",Ted
5046,"He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay?",Lily
5047,"Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part.",Robin
5048,"What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out.",Lily
5049,"I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat.",Robin
5050,"All right, we'll swing by the party.",Robin
5051,"Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers.",Robin
5052,"Okay, where are the guys and the hooker?",Lily
5053,"Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted.",Robin
5054,"Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.",Ted
5055,I know you would. It's the job.,Ted
5056,"I didn't want to ruin the party for everybody this early, but, uh... everyone take a seat. Um... Lily actually called off the wedding this summer to go to San Francisco. So... We're broken up.",Marshall
5057,"Yeah, that's not really the part I was worried about, guys.",Marshall
5058,"Guys, can we cease and desist with the lawyer speak for a minute? Love died. The love that made you all believe in love, that's dead now.",Marshall
5059,"Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?",Marshall
5060,See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup. Why? Because I listened to him. It was a strong and nurturing relationship that I threw away like old gum.,Lily
5061,"Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her?",Robin
5062,"Yes, that's the young lady.",Robin
5063,"Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing. Ted hates clubs.",Robin
5064,"Hell, yeah. I love clubs. I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight, kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum. But sure, let's go dancing.",Ted
5065,"Wait, let me just check with my friend.",Ted
5066,"Hey, Marshall. You up for some super loud, repetitive music that hasn't changed since the mid-90s?",Ted
5067,Um... only always.,Marshall
5068,Let's go.,Ted
5069,"Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to sex.",Robin
5070,Did you grow up in that Footloose town?,Lily
5071,"I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories.",Robin
5072,"Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine.",Lily
5073,He's not answering. Calling Marshall.,Robin
5074,Hello.,Marshall
5075,"Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted?",Robin
5076,"Oh, Robin, hi. Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. He's, uh... he's working.",Marshall
5077,"Uh, okay. Bye. <em>(She hangs up)</em> Marshall just lied. Ted's cheating on me.",Robin
5078,"Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier. One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair. And the other's a cheating bastard.",Robin
5079,"Okay, fella. Baby knows how this game's played. How's a $20 help your memory?",Lily
5080,Then can I have the...? That's cool. You keep that.,Lily
5081,So these guys... One of them's an architect.,Robin
5082,That's the one.,Robin
5083,"And then I was all, &quot;No, Frank Gehry, you're on your own this time.&quot; And that, my dear, was the end of that hack's career.",Ted
5084,That is one hell of a non sequitur.,Ted
5085,"Well, I don't know. But I suppose I should at least give you a ride home. Hop on. <em>(The girl jumps on Ted's back)</em>",Ted
5086,"Dude, dude, what are you doing?",Marshall
5087,Galloping.,Ted
5088,"You proved it, all right? The whole &quot;Ted Mosby, architect&quot; things works.",Marshall
5089,"Aren't you a little worried that a certain somebody might find out that you're doing this? This isn't you, Ted.",Marshall
5090,It is tonight. Whoo!,Ted
5091,You know this girl. Where does she live?,Robin
5092,"Well, I'm out of money.",Lily
5093,"I'm cashed, too.",Robin
5094,My purse?,Robin
5095,"Okay, fine.",Robin
5096,You should tell her that looks really good with a chocolate boot.,Lily
5097,Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse. No room for my g*n. Here. Now where does the rodeo slut live?,Robin
5098,"Oh, my God, Robin, are you going to kick this girl's ass?",Lily
5099,Yeah... And steal her purse.,Robin
5100,"I can't believe he's cheating on me. You know how many times I could have cheated? Six... no seven. And you know two of them, and they would surprise you.",Robin
5101,"3-C, let's do this. You ready?",Lily
5102,Should I just kick the door in?,Robin
5103,"Those are really nice heels and you already lost the purse. Let's see if it's unlocked. It's unlocked. Okay, get in there and kick some spankable ass. Robin?",Lily
5104,I'm the problem.,Robin
5105,What?,Lily
5106,You were right. I don't know how to be a girlfriend. I took the nicest guy in the world and I made him a cheater.,Robin
5107,"Well, don't stand out here and b*at yourself up. Get in there and b*at Ted up. I'll handle the slutty kickboxer. Actually, I'll take Ted.",Lily
5108,Let's do this.,Robin
5109,Bring it. <em>(They come in)</em>,Lily
5110,What do you think you're...? Barney?,Robin
5111,"Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?",Robin
5112,Ted? He's at work.,Barney
5113,How did you get here?,Robin
5114,Awesome story. As per usual.,Barney
5115,Solid point. And she did have hair of gold.,Ted
5116,"Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands.",Ted
5117,"Yeah, stay <em>(mouthing &quot;go&quot;)</em>",Barney
5118,"Excuse us for one second. <em>(To Barney)</em> Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder.",Ted
5119,"Yeah, you did.",Barney
5120,"Yeah, had to. See ya. <em>(He leaves)</em>",Ted
5121,Ted Mosby... Architect.,Barney
5122,But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.,Barney
5123,"Dude, dude, what are you doing?",Marshall
5124,Galloping.,Barney
5125,"All right, you proved it. The whole &quot;Ted Mosby, architect&quot; thing works.",Marshall
5126,"Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted.",Marshall
5127,It is tonight.,Barney
5128,"And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here.",Barney
5129,But why would you use Ted's name?,Robin
5130,I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole &quot;using my real name&quot; thing.,Barney
5131,"Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.",Lily
5132,Everything isn't okay. Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid.,Robin
5133,This is how people act in relationships.,Lily
5134,And that's why I avoid relationships.,Robin
5135,"Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it.",Lily
5136,"And thus ended this chapter of, &quot;Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand.&quot; Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower.",Barney
5137,You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?,Robin
5138,"I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a &quot;A.&quot; A... A... I'll just put &quot;resident.&quot; Go, go, go, go.",Barney
5139,Hey.,Robin
5140,Hey. What are you doing here?,Ted
5141,"I brought donuts. And I don't want to brag, but they're filled with jelly.",Robin
5142,"Thanks. So, uh... how was your night?",Ted
5143,It was... fine. Nothing exciting. How was yours?,Robin
5144,You really want to hear about boring architect stuff?,Ted
5145,"Yes, I do. I'm sorry about earlier. To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of <em>Field of Dreams</em>. I fell asleep half way through.",Robin
5146,What? The best part's the last 20 minutes.,Ted
5147,"Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause... You know what, um... What I'm trying to say is... I love being the person you bitch to. So how was your day, Mr. Architect?",Robin
5148,"Oh, I like the way you say that. Hey, you want to see the building that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate?",Ted
5149,Obviously. Wow.,Robin
5150,Yes.,Ted
5151,"You know, you didn't mention all the foliage around the base. If you trim that back, the rest would look bigger.",Robin
5152,"You don't have to tell me. And, um... just for fun, I've... I've sort of been working on my own idea of what I think the building should be. What do you think?",Ted
5153,"Wow. Ted, this is amazing.",Robin
5154,Thanks. It's not like it will ever come to anything.,Ted
5155,"I don't know. It might come to something. You know, girls find architects very hot. <em>(They kiss)</em>",Robin
5156,"Okay, but I don't want you expecting 78 storeys or anything. <em>(They kiss again)</em>",Ted
5157,Aaaaaaah!,Barney
5158,Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!,Lily
5159,Welcome to my new home.,Lily
5160,"Oh, wow, Lily, this is... Oh, this is all of it.",Ted
5161,"Yeah,I know it's small, but it's got character. Thank you. And I am learning Lithuanian from my neighbors. They're great. They're always out there in the hall, you know, cooking and gambling and giving each other haircuts. It's nice.",Lily
5162,"Hey,is that a toilet in your kitchen?",Ted
5163,Or a stove in your bathroom?,Robin
5164,"Oh, that's not just a stove. That's a stovenkerator: a combination of a stove, oven and sink and refrigerator. Stovenkerator. Isn't that futuristic?",Lily
5165,"God,I hope not. Hey, cool murphy bed.",Ted
5166,"It's kind of a mess. I didn't make my bed this morning, so...",Lily
5167,Oh! You know what? I bet sleeping at this angle is good for you. For some reason.,Robin
5168,"Hold on, I got it.",Ted
5169,"That was &quot;something, something, I am going to something you like a something donkey.",Lily
5170,Uh. Other cultures!,Robin
5171,"Hey, let's break out the fruit basket. Hey, who ate all the...? <em>(Mouse squeaking)</em> Aaaaaah!",Lily
5172,"Okay, we have to get Lily out of that apartment. Her roommate is a raccoon.",Ted
5173,"I'd offer her my place, but I've got dogs and she's allergic.",Robin
5174,Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think she's a little more allergic to that.,Ted
5175,"What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery, but it's gotta have a couch.",Robin
5176,The fortress of barnitude? No way.,Barney
5177,Come on. She's desperate.,Robin
5178,"Hmm, normally a prerequisite for the women I bring home, but... pass.",Barney
5179,Absolutely not.,Robin
5180,No.,Ted
5181,"Damn! I got these tickets like months ago for me and Lily and now I can't find anyone to go with me. This is what I miss about being in a couple. I always had someone to go to concerts with, or farmer's market, or brunch. God, I miss brunch!",Marshall
5182,"Well, I guess you could - well, you could try going to brunch alone.",Ted
5183,"Oh, you don't think I've tried?",Marshall
5184,Table for one.,Marshall
5185,"Um, no, just me.",Marshall
5186,You're right. Who am I kidding?,Marshall
5187,"Oh, the Popover Pantry! That place is great. Can we go get brunch tomorrow?",Robin
5188,"Of course, sweetie.",Ted
5189,Can I go with you guys?,Marshall
5190,Really? For brunch?,Ted
5191,"God, I hate being single!",Marshall
5192,Ted gave me your spare key.,Lily
5193,Spare key! Brilliant!,Ted
5194,"I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here if I had no other choice. But earlier today, I was getting ready to go to sleep and...",Lily
5195,"That's terrible. Well, see ya.",Barney
5196,"Wait, can I stay here maybe?",Lily
5197,"I'd let you, but I don't have any room.",Barney
5198,You live in a two-bedroom apartment. You have one room just for your suits.,Lily
5199,"Hey I'm at a point in my life where my suits are my family. Look around you Lily. You are in the heart of bachelor country, and as a woman, you are an illegal immigrant here. Now,you can try to apply for a sex visa, but that only lasts 12 hours. 14 if you qualify for multiple entry.",Barney
5200,"Ewww!...Is something some lame, judgmental chick would say, but I say give me multiple high fives.",Lily
5201,"Wow, you really are desperate.",Barney
5202,I really am.,Lily
5203,"Oh okay, you can stay here for two days. But I only have one rule. You can't change anything.",Barney
5204,Why would I change anything? This place is... Perfect. Except for the fact that you don't have a TV.,Lily
5205,"See that wall? 300-inch flat-screen. They only sell them in Japan, but I know a guy. Had to ship it over in a tugboat like freakin' King Kong.",Barney
5206,It hurts my eyes.,Lily
5207,Yeah. That doesn't go away.,Barney
5208,"Hey, where have you been?",Ted
5209,The Alanis Morissette concert.,Marshall
5210,By yourself?,Ted
5211,"No,actually I went with a friend from law school.",Marshall
5212,"Oh,really? Who's this friend?",Robin
5213,Brad.,Marshall
5214,Totally! I can't believe I almost didn't come tonight.,Marshall
5215,"Yeah, how'd you know?",Marshall
5216,"What? Kara broke up with you? I'm sorry,man. That sucks. Brad,do you like brunch?",Marshall
5217,You invited him to brunch?,Ted
5218,"Yeah, I invited him to brunch. Why? Is that weird?",Marshall
5219,Yes. That's why I was all &quot;you invited him to brunch?&quot;,Ted
5220,Why can't two guys who are friends go to brunch?,Marshall
5221,Because brunch is kind of...,Ted
5222,Girly.,Robin
5223,Girly? Breakfast isn't girly. Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly?,Marshall
5224,"I don't know. There's nothing girly about a horse, nothing girly about a horn, but put them together and you get a unicorn.",Ted
5225,"I don't care what either of you say, I am going to the Popover Pantry with Brad. We're here. We're hungry. Get used to it, brunch.",Marshall
5226,"Uhm, smells delicious.",Barney
5227,"Thank you. There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up... <em>(Barney puts the breakfast in the trash)</em> What are you doing?",Lily
5228,"Lily, what was the first rule again?",Barney
5229,&quot;Don't change anything&quot;?,Lily
5230,And what was the second rule?,Barney
5231,There was no second rule.,Lily
5232,Exactly! There was only one rule and you broke it.,Barney
5233,I bought groceries. That counts as changing something?,Lily
5234,"Lily, if I wanted a fridge full of groceries or fresh coffee in the morning, I'd be in a relationship. But I don't want to be in a relationship. That's why I make it crystal-clear to every girl that walks through that door that this is not a place to leave a toothbrush. This is not a place to leave a contact lens case. This is a place to leave. Come on, 'll give you a tour. Uh, no flash photography please. <em>Bienvenido</em> to the bedroom. Dig this: King-sized bed, full-sized blanket, one pillow. Everything about this bed says &quot;our work here is done.&quot; Next we say <em>bienvenue</em> to the bathroom. What, only one towel? What, no hairdryer? You know where I keep that stuff? Your place. b*at it. And the <em>coup de gr&amp;acirc;ce</em>... Yeah, that's right. Patent-pending. And <em>wilkommen</em> to the hallway. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p*rn...",Barney
5235,Marshall doesn't have p*rn.,Lily
5236,"Aww, that's sweet. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p*rn, I had mine professionally lit. Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough.",Barney
5237,"And if that doesn't drive them away, there's always your life-sized storm-trooper.",Lily
5238,"No,that's just awesome. So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here, I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else. My apartment does it for me.",Barney
5239,"God, I love brunch.",Marshall
5240,"This isn't weird, right?",Marshall
5241,Right? Right?,Marshall
5242,"Exactly. Thank you, that's exactly what I've been saying.",Marshall
5243,What are you talking about?,Marshall
5244,Yeah!,Marshall
5245,Hey. Did the cold wake you?,Barney
5246,"Oh,did you try and take a shower? I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel.",Barney
5247,"Okay. I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to...",Barney
5248,"I think I left something on the bookshelf. Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look <em>(he shows her his p*rn)</em> Oh, I'm disgusting.",Barney
5249,"Whoa, uh, okay. Beep beep. Backing up, um...",Barney
5250,What? No. Yes!,Barney
5251,Yes.,Barney
5252,"Come on, baby. please, no. You don't understand. What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...? <em>(The girl is gone. To Lily)</em> You're not going anywhere. Live claritin clear. Wow, that was close. That hippie chick wouldn't leave. She was ready to squat here.",Barney
5253,"Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?",Lily
5254,She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment... Except you. You're better than p*rn.,Barney
5255,Thank you.,Lily
5256,"How would you like to extend your stay here? All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife, and scare off the occasional one-night stand. I know,I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles...",Barney
5257,I'll do it.,Lily
5258,Really?,Barney
5259,"Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win.",Lily
5260,I'll take it.,Barney
5261,<em>Mamma mia!?</em>,Ted
5262,"<em>Mamma mia!</em>. You know what? It's supposed to be a great musical, okay? It won all sorts of Tonies and stuff.",Marshall
5263,"No, totally. It sounds like a really, really fun, exciting, third date.",Ted
5264,"Ooh, third date. You know what that means.",Robin
5265,"It is not a date,okay. It's just two bros taking in a Broadway show.",Marshall
5266,You bros going to get dinner beforehand?,Ted
5267,"We might grab a steak, yeah.",Marshall
5268,Where at?,Ted
5269,"<em>CafÃ© l'amour</em>. <em>(Ted and Robin laugh)</em> Brad says the food is really good there, okay?",Marshall
5270,Sounds like Brad's got quite the night planned out. You better bring your &quot;A&quot; game. That means no granny panties.,Robin
5271,"All right, you know what? You two are just threatened because I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' stuff. Well, guess what? It's my territory now. I'm peeing all over brunches, fancy dinners and musicals. That's right. Brad and I are taking back Broadway.",Marshall
5272,What are you going to wear?,Ted
5273,"I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin... <em>(Ted and Robin laugh)</em> Oh, you know what? Shut up.",Marshall
5274,Can you pass the arts and leisure? (The girl does it. More loudly) Can you pass the arts and leisure?,Barney
5275,"Lily, I can explain...",Barney
5276,How could you? In our own home? <em>(She slaps him)</em> You bastard!,Lily
5277,Just get out. This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years to put you through medical school? I got breast implants for you. I... <em>(The girl is gone)</em> I was just about to turn on the tears.,Lily
5278,Brava. That was incredible. And that slap was genius. You did not hold back.,Barney
5279,"Yeah, that I just always wanted to do.",Lily
5280,"Fair enough. I have to say, it's kind of nice having food around here for a change.",Barney
5281,"You know... Oh nah, never mind.",Lily
5282,What? You're my wife. You can tell me anything.,Barney
5283,"Well,if you really wanted to sell this ruse, we should try to make this place a little more... You know, homey. Like... Like a woman would actually live here.",Lily
5284,What did you have in mind?,Barney
5285,"Hey,you're home. I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning.",Ted
5286,"Ha,ha,ha,ha. It wasn't a date. Okay, it was a date and it got way weird.",Marshall
5287,"Oh, you really don't have to do that.",Marshall
5288,"Thanks, Brad.",Marshall
5289,Woah!,Ted
5290,"Well, it could have been worse. It could have fallen in your lap.",Robin
5291,It gets worse.,Marshall
5292,"No, I can do it, Brad. Okay,thank you.",Marshall
5293,You want me to go to a wedding with you?,Marshall
5294,"Okay, that's not too bad. Two single guys on the prowl. It'll be like &quot;Wedding crashers&quot;.",Ted
5295,Just keep Brad away from the bouquet.,Robin
5296,It gets worse.,Marshall
5297,Vermont?,Marshall
5298,"You said no, right?",Ted
5299,Of course.,Marshall
5300,I'll go to Vermont with you.,Marshall
5301,I'm sorry. It's not funny anymore.,Ted
5302,"Damn you,brunch! This guy's crazy, right?",Marshall
5303,"Look,I don't think he's crazy. I just think he's suffering from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal. And unfortunately, you're his nicotine patch.",Ted
5304,And now you have to do what every dysfunctional couple has to do: Break up.,Robin
5305,"You're right. You're right. I promised brad I would go to the wedding with him,and then that is it.",Marshall
5306,Good man.,Ted
5307,"Oh,I think we made the right decision going for the custom-made italian sheets.",Lily
5308,"Hey, if my bed's going suit up, it's going to do it right. Want to give it a whirl?",Barney
5309,"All right, I'm going to head out, hit the bars. What are you going to do tonight?",Barney
5310,"Oh, I was just going to watch &quot;Letterman&quot; but, God this bed is so comfy. I wish you had a TV in here. <em>(Barney turns on a another wall-size TV)</em> Okay, seriously, what do you do for a living?",Lily
5311,Please. <em>(He settles himself on the bed)</em>,Barney
5312,I thought you were going out.,Lily
5313,Eh. After the monologue.,Barney
5314,"No. No... No. No! No! <em>(On the phone)</em> Ted. Um, Brad got me flowers.",Marshall
5315,Hold on. <em>(To Robin)</em> Brad got him flowers. <em>(They laugh)</em> I'm sorry. It just got funny again. <em>(Marshall hangs up)</em>,Ted
5316,"No, Brad, uh, I don't want to hear it. I do like you. And calla lilies are my favorite flower. I don't know how you knew that. I guess you just get me, but this is not cool, man. I can't believe that you would...",Marshall
5317,"Hi, Kara. So you guys,are like back together now?",Marshall
5318,"Yeah, you should have.",Marshall
5319,"Don't, Brad. Just don't. <em>(He leaves)</em>",Marshall
5320,Aaaaaah!,Barney
5321,Aaaaaaaaaaah!,Lily
5322,I can't believe we just... You and I... What have we done?,Barney
5323,Nothing. Nothing happened. We... We just went to sleep.,Lily
5324,&quot;Just went to sleep&quot;? I don't sleep in the same bed as a woman and not make a move. How could... You! You spooned me against my will.,Barney
5325,"Hey,it takes two to cuddle.",Lily
5326,"We... We redecorated my place. We stayed in on a friday night to watch &quot;Letterman&quot;, and then slept together and didn't have sex? Oh my God! We're in a relationship!",Barney
5327,That's what you think a relationship is?,Lily
5328,"You were supposed to be the vaccine, but you gave me the disease. You gotta go.",Barney
5329,"Barney. I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself. You let down your guard, and let someone into your life, and... And it actually felt okay. And that terrifies you.",Lily
5330,Uh-uh. You gotta go.,Barney
5331,"Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place, and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living.",Lily
5332,&quot;A certain standard of living&quot;? You didn't pay a single...,Barney
5333,"Oh my God, it's Brad. Laugh like I said something really funny. <em>(Ted laughs)</em>",Marshall
5334,That was great.,Ted
5335,Right? Right?,Marshall
5336,"Oh, hey, hey, how's it going?",Marshall
5337,"Yeah, I know who you are.",Ted
5338,"Yeah, me too, but more important.",Marshall
5339,"Sure. Sure. <em>(Brad leaves)</em> Even if you don't believe it, tell me he looks fat.",Marshall

5341,It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.,Lily
5342,I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.,Lily
5343,What is she doing for money through all this?,Ted
5344,"Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.",Robin
5345,"Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?",Ted
5346,No.,Robin
5347,Here she comes. Here she comes.,Marshall
5348,"Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.",Lily
5349,I'm sorry.,Robin
5350,"Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. <em>(Marshall takes a photo of her).</em>",Barney
5351,What do you want?,Lily
5352,I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.,Ted
5353,"Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.",Lily
5354,I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?,Barney
5355,No.,Ted
5356,"My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.",Lily
5357,"Robin, nothing to add?",Ted
5358,No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.,Robin
5359,Thank you.,Lily
5360,"Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.",Robin
5361,I've never need the beer more than I do right now.,Marshall
5362,"I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, &quot;dude, my semester is gonna be this.&quot;",Ted
5363,"Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.",Marshall
5364,"Really? Laid, you say?",Barney
5365,"You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.",Marshall
5366,She hot?,Barney
5367,"Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.",Marshall
5368,And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.,Barney
5369,A what?,Robin
5370,"A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.",Barney
5371,What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?,Ted
5372,"Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.",Barney
5373,I didn't challenge you to have sex with...,Marshall
5374,"Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.",Barney
5375,Classic.,Marshall
5376,"Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?",Robin
5377,Yeah. Somebody did just quit.,Ted
5378,"So, where should we eat today? <em>(looking at the assistant with a whole chicken in a container)</em> Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? <em>(the girl leaves, crying)",Ted
5379,"Dude, that is cold-blooded.",Marshall
5380,"It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.",Ted
5381,"Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.",Robin
5382,It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?,Ted
5383,"Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",Barney
5384,"So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?",Ted
5385,What would I be doing?,Lily
5386,"Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.",Ted
5387,You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.,Ted
5388,"Oh, right, is that the...?",Lily
5389,Yeah. Here's the model.,Ted
5390,You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant penis.,Lily
5391,"I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.",Ted
5392,How can he not see it? I mean there's the...,Lily
5393,I know.,Ted
5394,And the way it...,Lily
5395,I know.,Ted
5396,And the two little...,Lily
5397,I know.,Ted
5398,It is just...,Lily
5399,"Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.",Ted
5400,Nice to meet you.,Lily
5401,"I, uh... I am an architect.",Ted
5402,"Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.",Ted
5403,Absolutely.,Ted
5404,Styrofoam trees.,Ted
5405,Styrofoam trees.,Ted
5406,Styrofoam trees!,Ted
5407,"Man, that guy is a total, well... <em>(gestures to the building model)</em>",Lily
5408,"Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.",Marshall
5409,"Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",Barney
5410,"Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.",Marshall
5411,"Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?",Barney
5412,"Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.",Marshall
5413,Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.,Barney
5414,I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.,Lily
5415,"He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. <em>(The girls giggle)</em> You know what I mean: crotchety. <em>(Giggles)</em> I'm just saying it's been hard on him. <em>(More giggles).</em> All right stop.",Ted
5416,Did you show lily your design?,Robin
5417,No.,Ted
5418,What design?,Lily
5419,It's nothing.,Ted
5420,"It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.",Robin
5421,"Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.",Lily
5422,"Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. <em>(Giggles)</em> All right, enough!",Ted
5423,"Oh, my god. Incredible.",Barney
5424,C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!,Barney
5425,Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.,Lily
5426,"Okay, I'm done.",Ted
5427,Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.,Lily
5428,Great. Thanks.,Ted
5429,"Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.",Ted
5430,Too green?,Ted
5431,I can't un-picture it.,Ted
5432,What? What's gone?,Ted
5433,"Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.",Ted
5434,"Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.",Ted
5435,"Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? <em>(Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)</em>",Ted
5436,Hey.,Lily
5437,"Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?",Ted
5438,That's easy. I took it.,Lily
5439,Why?,Ted
5440,It's simple.,Lily
5441,"Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",Lily
5442,What does his ball have to do with anything?,Ted
5443,"Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",Lily
5444,"Hey, guys. What's going on?",Robin
5445,Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,Ted
5446,Why? Was he being mean?,Robin
5447,You know about this?,Ted
5448,Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?,Robin
5449,"Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.",Lily
5450,I gave them to you for your birthday.,Robin
5451,So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?,Ted
5452,I prefer to call them &quot;justice khakis.&quot;,Lily
5453,"That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.",Ted
5454,So is being mean.,Lily
5455,"Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",Ted
5456,"Well, that's why I left a note.",Lily
5457,A note?,Ted
5458,"Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.",Lily
5459,"Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.",Ted
5460,I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.,Lily
5461,"I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",Marshall
5462,"I know, I know.",Barney
5463,You claim to have so much sex. I only assumed you'd be good at it.,Marshall
5464,"Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",Barney
5465,"Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.",Marshall
5466,"I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.",Barney
5467,I think I'm falling in love with you.,Barney
5468,What? No.We had sex yesterday.,Barney
5469,"When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, &quot;who wants espresso?&quot; So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",Ted
5470,No.,Lily
5471,"What do you mean, no?",Ted

5479,"This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",Ted
5480,"All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",Lily
5481,No. You'll give it back or you're fired.,Ted
5482,"I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",Lily
5483,Then you're fired.,Ted
5484,Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.,Lily
5485,"Dude, you're k*ll me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",Marshall

5487,So you're going back over there?,Marshall

5489,I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,Barney
5490,"But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",Barney
5491,"Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",Ted
5492,Lily was mentally deranged.,Ted
5493,Lily was mentally deranged!,Ted

5501,"Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...",Ted
5502,"No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.",Lily

5504,"Barney! Oh, my god!",Robin
5505,What happened?,Ted
5506,"That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.",Barney
5507,"Professor Lewis, hi.",Marshall
5508,"Yeah, she was.",Barney
5509,"B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that &quot;A&quot;!",Barney

5512,It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.,Lily
5513,I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.,Lily
5514,What is she doing for money through all this?,Ted
5515,"Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.",Robin
5516,"Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?",Ted
5517,No.,Robin
5518,Here she comes. Here she comes.,Marshall
5519,"Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.",Lily
5520,I'm sorry.,Robin
5521,"Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. <em>(Marshall takes a photo of her).</em>",Barney
5522,What do you want?,Lily
5523,I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.,Ted
5524,"Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.",Lily
5525,I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?,Barney
5526,No.,Ted
5527,"My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.",Lily
5528,"Robin, nothing to add?",Ted
5529,No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.,Robin
5530,Thank you.,Lily
5531,"Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.",Robin
5532,I've never need the beer more than I do right now.,Marshall
5533,"I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, &quot;dude, my semester is gonna be this.&quot;",Ted
5534,"Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.",Marshall
5535,"Really? Laid, you say?",Barney
5536,"You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.",Marshall
5537,She hot?,Barney
5538,"Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.",Marshall
5539,And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.,Barney
5540,A what?,Robin
5541,"A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.",Barney
5542,What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?,Ted
5543,"Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.",Barney
5544,I didn't challenge you to have sex with...,Marshall
5545,"Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.",Barney
5546,Classic.,Marshall
5547,"Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?",Robin
5548,Yeah. Somebody did just quit.,Ted
5549,"So, where should we eat today? <em>(looking at the assistant with a whole chicken in a container)</em> Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? <em>(the girl leaves, crying)",Ted
5550,"Dude, that is cold-blooded.",Marshall
5551,"It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.",Ted
5552,"Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.",Robin
5553,It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?,Ted
5554,"Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",Barney
5555,"So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?",Ted
5556,What would I be doing?,Lily
5557,"Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.",Ted
5558,You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.,Ted
5559,"Oh, right, is that the...?",Lily
5560,Yeah. Here's the model.,Ted
5561,You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant penis.,Lily
5562,"I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.",Ted
5563,How can he not see it? I mean there's the...,Lily
5564,I know.,Ted
5565,And the way it...,Lily
5566,I know.,Ted
5567,And the two little...,Lily
5568,I know.,Ted
5569,It is just...,Lily
5570,"Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.",Ted
5571,Nice to meet you.,Lily
5572,"I, uh... I am an architect.",Ted
5573,"Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.",Ted
5574,Absolutely.,Ted
5575,Styrofoam trees.,Ted
5576,Styrofoam trees.,Ted
5577,Styrofoam trees!,Ted
5578,"Man, that guy is a total, well... <em>(gestures to the building model)</em>",Lily
5579,"Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.",Marshall
5580,"Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",Barney
5581,"Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.",Marshall
5582,"Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?",Barney
5583,"Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.",Marshall
5584,Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.,Barney
5585,I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.,Lily
5586,"He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. <em>(The girls giggle)</em> You know what I mean: crotchety. <em>(Giggles)</em> I'm just saying it's been hard on him. <em>(More giggles).</em> All right stop.",Ted
5587,Did you show lily your design?,Robin
5588,No.,Ted
5589,What design?,Lily
5590,It's nothing.,Ted
5591,"It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.",Robin
5592,"Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.",Lily
5593,"Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. <em>(Giggles)</em> All right, enough!",Ted
5594,"Oh, my god. Incredible.",Barney
5595,C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!,Barney
5596,Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.,Lily
5597,"Okay, I'm done.",Ted
5598,Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.,Lily
5599,Great. Thanks.,Ted
5600,"Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.",Ted
5601,Too green?,Ted
5602,I can't un-picture it.,Ted
5603,What? What's gone?,Ted
5604,"Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.",Ted
5605,"Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.",Ted
5606,"Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? <em>(Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)</em>",Ted
5607,Hey.,Lily
5608,"Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?",Ted
5609,That's easy. I took it.,Lily
5610,Why?,Ted
5611,It's simple.,Lily
5612,"Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",Lily
5613,What does his ball have to do with anything?,Ted
5614,"Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",Lily
5615,"Hey, guys. What's going on?",Robin
5616,Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,Ted
5617,Why? Was he being mean?,Robin
5618,You know about this?,Ted
5619,Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?,Robin
5620,"Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.",Lily
5621,I gave them to you for your birthday.,Robin
5622,So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?,Ted
5623,I prefer to call them &quot;justice khakis.&quot;,Lily
5624,"That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.",Ted
5625,So is being mean.,Lily
5626,"Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",Ted
5627,"Well, that's why I left a note.",Lily
5628,A note?,Ted
5629,"Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.",Lily
5630,"Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.",Ted
5631,I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.,Lily
5632,"I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",Marshall
5633,"I know, I know.",Barney
5634,You claim to have so much sex. I only assumed you'd be good at it.,Marshall
5635,"Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",Barney
5636,"Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.",Marshall
5637,"I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.",Barney
5638,I think I'm falling in love with you.,Barney
5639,What? No.We had sex yesterday.,Barney
5640,"When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, &quot;who wants espresso?&quot; So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",Ted
5641,No.,Lily
5642,"What do you mean, no?",Ted
5643,"I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.",Lily
5644,"Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.",Ted
5645,&quot;Who wants espresso?&quot;,Lily
5646,Interesting.,Lily
5647,"Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.",Lily
5648,Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.,Ted
5649,"No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",Lily
5650,"This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",Ted
5651,"All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",Lily
5652,No. You'll give it back or you're fired.,Ted
5653,"I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",Lily
5654,Then you're fired.,Ted
5655,Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.,Lily
5656,"Dude, you're k*ll me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",Marshall
5657,Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.,Barney
5658,So you're going back over there?,Marshall
5659,"Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the &quot;cougar&quot; once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",Barney
5660,I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,Barney
5661,"But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",Barney
5662,"Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",Ted
5663,Lily was mentally deranged.,Ted
5664,Lily was mentally deranged!,Ted
5665,Wait! We have one more idea for you.,Ted
5666,I have another design.,Ted

5683,"Oh, my God. These pancakes are delicious!",Lily
5684,"Yes! Thank you. Uhm, I learned how to cook while you were gone this summer.",Marshall
5685,Oh. Do you want to cook dinner tonight?,Lily
5686,"Yeah, sure. How about pancakes?",Marshall
5687,"You may not have much range, but at least I'm marrying a guy who knows how to make pancakes.",Lily
5688,"Oh, uhm...",Marshall
5689,"I mean, uhm... Well, I... I realize that we haven't really discussed whether us getting back together means us getting married, but... I still wanna. Do you still wanna?",Lily
5690,Really?,Marshall
5691,"Of course, I love you.",Lily
5692,"No, I mean, that's how you're gonna do it? &quot;Do you still wanna?&quot; That's like the lamest proposal ever. When I did it, I got down on my knees... I don't know, I'm just saying.",Marshall
5693,"No, no, no, no, no, no.",Marshall
5694,What?!,Lily
5695,"You can't lead with that. You got to... build up to that. You got to have, like, a little speech.",Marshall
5696,Do you remember your proposal to me? <em>(She puts her hand on her eye)</em>,Lily
5697,I had a speech prepared.,Marshall
5698,What do you want to hear?,Lily
5699,"I don't know. I mean, you could tell me, like, about how good-looking and funny and smart I am and I've been working out lately. It might be nice for you to mention something about that.",Marshall
5700,Marshall... You are good-looking...,Lily
5701,Thank you.,Marshall
5702,Funny...,Lily
5703,"Oh, thanks.",Marshall
5704,Smart...,Lily
5705,And a few tears wouldn't hurt.,Marshall
5706,"Okay, would you freakin' marry me already?",Lily
5707,"I'll marry you. Of course. But, uhm, until you see a ring on this finger, don't expect me to put out.",Marshall
5708,"Yeah, right. <em>(They kiss)</em>",Lily
5709,I'll give you this. That was a very creative use of syrup.,Marshall
5710,"I can't even look Mrs. Butterworth in the eye. Oh, my God. We're getting married!",Lily
5711,"I know, I know.",Marshall
5712,"Man, I made a big mess by canceling this wedding, didn't I?",Lily
5713,"It's okay, baby. You're not just realizing that now, are you?",Marshall
5714,"God, the idea of standing up there in front of all those people who hate my guts... Just makes me want to run off to Atlantic City and get married today.",Lily
5715,Yeah...,Marshall
5716,Coming up at 11:00: Are there piranhas in the East River? What you don't know... could eat you.,Robin
5717,Robin! Stop the news!,Marshall
5718,It's okay. They're my friends.,Robin
5719,We're going to Atlantic City to elope. You got to come with us.,Lily
5720,"Oh, my God, that is so fantastic! I don't know if I can just leave work.",Robin
5721,Let's go to Atlantic City!,Robin
5722,"You guys are eloping! Oh, that's fantastic. Wait, is this because there's a time crunch Uncle Ted should know about?",Ted
5723,I hope not because I plan on getting hammered.,Lily
5724,"Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work. I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager.",Ted
5725,"Ted, for the rest of our lives, we are going to be telling the amazing story of how we went to Atlantic City and got married. Don't you want to be in that story?",Lily
5726,Of course I do. Let's go to Atlantic City!,Ted
5727,Yeah!,Marshall
5728,"Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate?",Ted
5729,You got it.,Marshall
5730,"Hey, guys.",Barney
5731,Wow. A pedicure.,Ted
5732,"Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine.",Barney
5733,We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!,Lily
5734,"Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?",Barney
5735,So are you in or not?,Marshall
5736,"Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done.",Barney
5737,"No, we got to get going to the...",Marshall
5738,"Well, actually, I mean... It is my wedding day, and since we're here...",Lily
5739,Wow. Look at this place. I guess I'll have my pick of something old.,Lily
5740,And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.,Marshall
5741,"Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend.",Barney
5742,You been here before?,Ted
5743,"Oh, uh, once or twice.",Barney
5744,"Ah, good to see you, too. Three times, maybe.",Barney
5745,The wedding chapel... This is it. Are you ready to do this?,Lily
5746,I'm ready. Let's get married.,Marshall
5747,"Oh, crap. I don't have a veil. I'm a bride, I can't get married without a veil. And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet. Oh, my God, we're getting married.",Lily
5748,"Don't worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey.",Robin
5749,"Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit.",Lily
5750,"Oh, really? Thanks.",Robin
5751,"Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride, you can't look better than me.",Lily
5752,Done. <em>(She leaves)</em>,Robin
5753,I'm going to get the bouquet. You guys get the veil. We'll meet in the chapel in 20 minutes. Ready? Break. <em>(She leaves)</em>,Lily
5754,You guys want to go gamble?,Ted
5755,"No, we got to go get the veil.",Marshall
5756,"Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one.",Ted
5757,"Yeah, okay.",Marshall
5758,"No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil. <em>(He leaves)</em>",Barney
5759,"So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life. I'm proud of you, buddy.",Ted
5760,Thanks.,Marshall
5761,How are you feeling?,Ted
5762,"Great, a little nervous.",Marshall
5763,Yeah? Craps?,Ted
5764,Not that nervous.,Marshall
5765,"No, I mean do you want to play craps.",Ted
5766,"Oh, yeah, definitely.",Marshall
5767,"Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?",Barney
5768,What did you just say?,Ted
5769,"Barney, no.",Marshall
5770,"Marshall, I'm your best man.",Barney
5771,You're not my best man.,Marshall
5772,Right here.,Ted
5773,"And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend.",Barney
5774,You're not my best friend.,Marshall
5775,Right here.,Ted
5776,"Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party. I've got, like, 18 minutes.",Marshall
5777,18 minutes...,Ted
5778,"Oh, good. Did you get the veil?",Lily
5779,Of course.,Barney
5780,And it took us exactly 18 minutes. We went to a strip club.,Marshall
5781,Dude!,Ted
5782,Unbelievable!,Barney
5783,We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance.,Marshall
5784,Your last lap dance ever.,Lily
5785,Right. What?,Marshall
5786,"Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City.",Ted
5787,Does it smell like strippers in here?,Robin
5788,"That's weird, right? Marshall and Lily are getting married!",Ted
5789,"Hell, yeah, look at this. <em>(She turns on her musical bouquet, playing the Wedding March)</em>",Lily
5790,"Oh, baby, this is it. Let's do this thing.",Marshall
5791,Hi. We're here to get married.,Lily
5792,We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine.,Marshall
5793,"Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen. Here, it looks like everyone brought their own.",Robin
5794,"No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point.",Lily
5795,"Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time.",Ted
5796,Have you been outside?,Lily
5797,There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana.,Ted
5798,"You guys, take it easy, guys. Are you sure about this?",Marshall
5799,Bright side: the bachelor party continues!,Barney
5800,Yes! Continues? You mean &quot;start.&quot; He means &quot;start.&quot; We went to a strip club.,Ted
5801,Is there any way that we could get a license today?,Lily
5802,"Well, we're in love.",Lily
5803,What better reason could there be?,Marshall
5804,"God, this is taking forever.",Marshall
5805,"I know. I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through. In fact, that crazy road has led them all the way here to Atlantic City...",Ted
5806,"Ted, up here.",Robin
5807,Uhm?,Ted
5808,You were just staring at my shirt boobs.,Robin
5809,"No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt.",Ted
5810,Hi.,Barney
5811,See you.,Barney
5812,What the hell was that?,Ted
5813,A... Chinese guy?,Barney
5814,"Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license, but we need to skip the waiting period because... We're in love.",Marshall
5815,"Oh, really?!",Lily
5816,"Oh. Well, so can we see a judge?",Lily
5817,Really?!,Lily
5818,Why are you doing this to us?!,Marshall
5819,Really?!,Robin
5820,You know what? We get it.,Marshall
5821,"Okay, this is a good plan B. Judges are people. People go to the bathroom. A judge is bound to come by eventually, and we'll get married. I'm sure we won't be waiting long.",Lily
5822,"Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds.",Marshall
5823,Vultures.,Barney
5824,What? Here?,Robin
5825,Yeah. Got a little time to k*ll.,Ted
5826,"Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it?",Robin
5827,No. A little.,Ted
5828,Something is seriously wrong with you.,Robin
5829,"So what, is that a no?",Ted
5830,"All right, let's do it.",Robin
5831,"All right. Um, also...?",Ted
5832,"Yes, I'll leave it on.",Robin
5833,Sweet.,Ted
5834,"Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative.",Lily
5835,"You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that b*llet.",Barney
5836,"Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on!",Lily
5837,Okay. May we please get married today?,Lily
5838,What was what?,Lily
5839,A look of love.,Marshall
5840,"You know, what's thick? what's thin?",Marshall
5841,"Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.",Lily
5842,I have.,Marshall
5843,They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had sex in the closet. What? We're under oath.,Barney
5844,"No, we're not.",Ted
5845,"Yeah, we are. He's a judge.",Barney
5846,Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?,Ted
5847,"Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it.",Barney
5848,Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen.,Marshall
5849,"No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today.",Lily
5850,"Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license.",Marshall
5851,Except international waters. So let's find a ship captain. A ship captain can marry us. There's boats all over this place.,Lily
5852,"Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage?",Ted
5853,This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go. (To a woman) Excuse me. Are you a ship captain?,Lily
5854,I should go talk to her.,Marshall
5855,"No, let me.",Robin
5856,Blackjack?,Ted
5857,Yeah.,Marshall
5858,"Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip, so we're getting closer.",Lily
5859,"Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today?",Robin
5860,"Because... If we don't do it today, I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people looking all disapproving and judging me while sipping little cups of mayonnaise and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long.",Lily
5861,Nobody's gonna do that.,Robin
5862,"No, they're not because I'm not gonna give them the chance. I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight.",Lily
5863,"Sweetie, this is crazy. You're never gonna find a ship capt...",Robin
5864,"Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain.",Marshall
5865,What?,Lily
5866,Yeah. First guy we talked to. Ship captain. How great is that?,Ted
5867,"See? See, this is destiny. So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us?",Lily
5868,What?,Marshall
5869,"Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it.",Lily
5870,I can get us that money.,Barney
5871,How?,Ted
5872,Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?,Barney
5873,Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?,Ted
5874,"Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called &quot;Shing Hasabu Shing&quot;. Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money.",Barney
5875,"No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away.",Robin
5876,"Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it.",Barney
5877,Do you understand what's happening?,Lily
5878,Not a clue.,Ted
5879,Do you think he's winning?,Robin
5880,I don't even know if he's playing.,Ted
5881,"Wait, I get it. I understand this game.",Marshall
5882,"No, you don't.",Ted
5883,"I totally understand the game, Theodore. Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean.",Marshall
5884,"Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm... My God, you're right.",Barney
5885,Wow. It's beautiful.,Lily
5886,"Thanks, Barney.",Marshall
5887,"Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling!",Barney
5888,"When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?",Ted
5889,Why can't I do it just a little?,Barney
5890,Okay. Let's get this started.,Lily
5891,"Yeah, serious is probably good.",Marshall
5892,This is pretty cool. I can't believe you never want to get married.,Ted
5893,I never said &quot;never.&quot;,Robin
5894,What was what?,Marshall
5895,We don't want to do this.,Lily
5896,We don't.,Marshall
5897,Are you kidding me? You guys are calling off another wedding?,Ted
5898,After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?,Robin
5899,"Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?",Barney
5900,You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?,Ted
5901,"Yes. Because it's gonna be amazing. Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family and I didn't want to do all that work, but... Now that we're here... I realize that I have to face Marshall's family and I really want to do all that work.",Lily
5902,"So do I. And yeah... My family might still be upset with you. But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other and none of that other stuff is gonna matter.",Marshall
5903,"I love you, Marshmallow.",Lily
5904,"I love you, too, Lilypad.",Marshall
5905,What?!,Lily
5906,Are... we married? Did you just marry us? Weren't you listening? We don't want to be married.,Marshall
5907,"Oh, whew... That was close.",Lily
5908,Hey... Ted.,Marshall

5911,You know how to make crepes? That is so cool.,Ted
5912,"And then there was Derek and counting you, that puts the total up to...",Robin
5913,"Oh, I got your total...counting along...",Ted
5914,You're scared of the Seven Dwarfs?,Ted
5915,"Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?",Robin
5916,"Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either.",Barney
5917,Why?,Robin
5918,"Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?",Barney
5919,"No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.",Robin
5920,"Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.",Barney
5921,"Come on, let's go.",Barney
5922,"All right, I'm in.",Robin
5923,To the Willowbrook Mall!,Barney
5924,"Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going.",Robin
5925,What? Why not?,Ted
5926,I just don't feel like going to a mall.,Robin
5927,We can split a cinnabun.,Lily
5928,"No, I'm really not gonna go.",Robin
5929,"Come on, it'll be fun.",Ted
5930,"No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls.",Robin
5931,Why not?,Barney
5932,I'd rather not say.,Robin
5933,"Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls. If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to. I think we should all just respect her privacy.",Ted
5934,Thanks Ted.,Robin
5935,"So, what's the deal with you and malls?",Ted
5936,"You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to.",Robin
5937,"Yeah, with those people. I'm your boyfriend. Come on, what is it? Did you get arrested in a mall?",Ted
5938,No.,Robin
5939,Dumped in a mall?,Ted
5940,Ted.,Robin
5941,Found out you were Canadian at a mall?,Ted
5942,Let it go.,Robin
5943,Trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Robin: Let it go.,Ted
5944,Mauled at the mall?,Ted
5945,"Let it go. And who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Ted: Not me in Ohio when I was nine, that's for sure.",Robin
5946,"What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?",Ted
5947,"Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment.",Barney
5948,The 'oh' moment?,Marshall
5949,"Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker.",Barney
5950,Oh.,Barney
5951,Oh.,Barney
5952,Oh.,Barney
5953,"So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible.",Barney
5954,"I disagree. If there's some potential 'oh' moment, I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative?",Ted
5955,I love you.,Ted
5956,I used to be a dude.,Robin
5957,"Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets.",Lily
5958,"You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox.",Barney
5959,It's true. They tell each other everything.,Ted
5960,I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you,Barney
5961,Try me.,Lily
5962,Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?,Barney
5963,Doggie ate his pants. Yep.,Lily
5964,Bill's bachelor party in Memphis.,Barney
5965,"Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?",Lily
5966,"OK, Seattle.",Barney
5967,"Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch.",Lily
5968,Damn.,Barney
5969,I'm not afraid of Sasquatch. I just think we should all be on alert.,Marshall
5970,"Trust me, not only do they tell each other everything. They want to know everything.",Ted
5971,"So, after the shower, I was brushing my teeth, and I was like, oh man, I wanted to have some orange juice, I should have done that first, but I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush so I just went ahead and brushed them anyway.",Marshall
5972,What happened next?,Lily
5973,"Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?",Barney
5974,You know?,Ted
5975,"Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p*rn, wait for it, ography.",Barney
5976,"Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous.",Ted
5977,"I don't know, he could be right. She does have the fake orgasm noises down.",Lily
5978,Hey.,Ted
5979,What? The walls are thin.,Lily
5980,That's not what I'm hey-ing you about.,Ted
5981,You know what it might be. This is gonna sound a little crazy but what if robin's married?,Marshall
5982,Married? What does have to do with the mall?,Ted
5983,"Well, maybe she got married at the mall. Back home in Minnesota a ton of people would get married at the Mall of America, it's great. It's a gorgeous indoor golf course for pictures. Numerous fine dining options, and talk about a reasonable price...",Marshall
5984,We're not getting married at the mall.,Lily
5985,Just meet with the guy.,Marshall
5986,She's not married. Robin hates marriage.,Ted
5987,"Because she already got married, at the mall.",Marshall
5988,"No, because before Robin moved to New York, she...What was she doing?",Lily
5989,"Well, I don't know, whenever I ask her about Canada, she kinda clams up.",Ted
5990,She's a pretty private person.,Marshall
5991,Except when she's talking about...,Lily
5992,A friend of mine in Canada got married way too young and it really turned her off to marriage.,Robin
5993,What do you think of this wedding cake?,Lily
5994,"Oh, I like it. Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada who got married too young? Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Field's giant cookie.",Robin
5995,No.,Lily
5996,"My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.",Robin
5997,They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess.,Barney
5998,"So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada?",Ted
5999,"Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted.",Marshall
6000,"Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it.",Barney
6001,Thank you Barney.,Ted
6002,'Cause it's p*rn.,Barney
6003,I need another beer.,Ted
6004,Robin is not in p*rn. I'll bet you anything that she's married.,Marshall
6005,"20,000 says it's p*rn.",Barney
6006,"I don't have 20,000.",Marshall
6007,"Well then, what do you have?",Barney
6008,Well.,Marshall
6009,No.,Lily
6010,I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet.,Barney
6011,"Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid.",Ted
6012,What the hell's a slap bet?,Lily
6013,"Whoever's right gets to slap the other person in the face as hard as they possibly can, but no rings.",Marshall
6014,Are you really gonna do that? That's so immature. Marshall: You can be Slap Bet Commissioner.,Lily
6015,"Oh, I love it. What are my powers?",Lily
6016,"Um, if a problem arises and we need a ruling, that's your job. Barney: But you have to be unbiased and put the integrity of slap bet above all else. This is an honor you will take with you to your grave. On your tombstone, it will read &quot;Lily Aldrin, caring wife, loving friend, Slap Bet Commissioner.&quot;",Marshall
6017,"And your tombstone will read, &quot;got slapped by Marshall so hard, he died.&quot;",Marshall
6018,"All right, what if I ask Robin point-blank if she has a husband?",Ted
6019,You said you would respect her privacy so maybe you should just drop it.,Lily
6020,"Yeah, you're right.",Ted
6021,Husband.,Ted
6022,There's no 'p' in husband.,Robin
6023,"Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands.",Ted
6024,"Fine, I'll take it back.",Ted
6025,"Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada.",Ted
6026,Huh.,Robin
6027,"I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that?",Ted
6028,"Are you asking me if I'm married? Ted: You can ask me. Nope, I'm not married. Your turn.",Robin
6029,"What happened to respecting my privacy? Ted: Just say, &quot;no, I'm not married.&quot;",Robin
6030,"Ted, I don't understand why you can't...",Robin
6031,"Just say, &quot;no, I'm not married.&quot;",Ted
6032,"I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married.",Robin
6033,Oh.,Ted
6034,You have a husband? Robin: I was young and stupid and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall and I haven't been to a mall since.,Ted
6035,Why didn't you get divorced?,Ted
6036,"He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough.",Robin
6037,"Good... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough.",Ted
6038,I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this.,Robin
6039,OK.,Ted
6040,Your hand is monstrous.,Barney
6041,"Well, what did you expect? You've seen my penis.",Marshall
6042,I can't believe you told us Robin's secret.,Lily
6043,How can I keep something like that to myself? And you begged me to tell you.,Ted
6044,No I didn't.,Lily
6045,"Please tell us, just tell us. I'm begging you. Tell us, tell us, tell us, please, please, please, please, please.",Lily
6046,"Fine, Robin's married.",Ted
6047,Ha ha ha.,Marshall
6048,"Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us. I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you?",Lily
6049,"See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?",Ted
6050,I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress.,Barney
6051,What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce?,Ted
6052,"Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage. It's like their money or their army. Nobody takes it seriously.",Lily
6053,It's serious to me.,Ted
6054,"You know what, in some countries, if you've been separated for longer than five years, technicall, you're no longer married. I can check it out at the law library at school.",Marshall
6055,I can see my hand print on your face.,Marshall
6056,"Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of p*rn from Canada I have to go through.",Barney
6057,I won the bet. Why are you still searching?,Marshall
6058,Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong.,Barney
6059,"Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch p*rn.",Lily
6060,"Canadian p*rn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go &quot;oat&quot; of my mind.",Barney
6061,Hey.,Ted
6062,"Hey. Listen, dude, I gotta talk to you, but you gotta promise me that you won't tell Barney.",Marshall
6063,"Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it?",Ted
6064,Robin's not married.,Marshall
6065,"What? Then, why would she tell me she was?",Ted
6066,I don't know but I cross-checked every record in Canada. There's no record of her ever being married.,Marshall
6067,There must be some mistake.,Ted
6068,"I promise you, she's not married. She's not great at parking legally either.",Marshall
6069,"So, she lied to me? What, what am I gonna do? I can't confront her 'cause then she'll know I told you.",Ted
6070,"You gotta lawyer her. You gotta ask her a bunch of questions, try to trip her up, maybe make her feel guilty, whatever it takes to get a confession out of her.",Marshall
6071,"Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest.",Ted
6072,Thanks Ted.,Robin
6073,"Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is.",Ted
6074,I say we just move on.,Robin
6075,"In order for me to get total closure on this whole my-girlfriend-has-a-husband thing, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more information. Like, what month did you get married? Robin: June. We had a June wedding.",Ted
6076,"Ah, Canada in June. That's great.",Ted
6077,Sit down or buffet.,Ted
6078,Um...,Robin
6079,Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember.,Ted
6080,"No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc.",Robin
6081,Hm. Band of DJ?,Ted
6082,"String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.",Robin
6083,How many bridesmaids? Robin: Seven.,Ted
6084,Flowers? Robin: Azaleas.,Ted
6085,Color scheme?,Ted
6086,Dusty rose and sienna.,Robin
6087,Husband's name?,Ted
6088,Um.,Robin
6089,You were never married.,Ted
6090,Yes I was.,Robin
6091,No you weren't.,Ted
6092,How do you know?,Robin
6093,I looked it up at the library.,Ted
6094,What library?,Robin
6095,The one on 5th.,Ted
6096,When did you go?,Robin
6097,Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad....,Ted
6098,"I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use?",Robin
6099,I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.,Ted
6100,You told Marshall?,Robin
6101,You lied to me!,Ted
6102,"See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret.",Robin
6103,But it was a fake secret.,Ted
6104,"Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too.",Robin
6105,"Testing me, that's insane.",Ted
6106,"Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world?",Robin
6107,That wasn't a real secret.,Ted
6108,"Yeah, but it could have been.",Robin
6109,You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.,Ted
6110,He moved there for business.,Robin
6111,"You, you got something to say to me?",Barney
6112,What are you talking about? Barney: I know Robin was never really married.,Marshall
6113,How could you possibly know that?,Marshall
6114,"Uh, let's see. Uh, first, I took the subway to school, and I got a bagel. Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married. Crazy. And then I was hungry again so I went down to the vending machine...",Marshall
6115,"You told him? Lily: I had to. I'm Slap Bet Commissioner. Baby, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you.",Marshall
6116,Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.,Barney
6117,Barney gets three slaps.,Lily
6118,Three?,Marshall
6119,One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.,Lily
6120,Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall: No. You're gonna cry.,Barney
6121,I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.,Ted
6122,"I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.",Robin
6123,So I just got a very interesting phone call.,Barney
6124,What are you talking about?,Ted
6125,I know Robin's secret.,Barney
6126,What?,Robin
6127,"That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now.",Barney
6128,"Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this.",Barney
6129,Yeah. No I don't.,Ted
6130,What?,Barney
6131,Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.,Ted
6132,"Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!",Barney
6133,"Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing.",Barney
6134,"Barney, don't, okay.",Robin
6135,"Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right.",Barney
6136,"No, Barney, I said we're not watching this.",Ted
6137,"No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it.",Robin
6138,Are you as terrified as I am?,Lily
6139,I don't wanna get slapped again.,Marshall
6140,I wanna stress that I was young.,Robin
6141,Yeah you were.,Barney
6142,And I didn't know any better.,Robin
6143,They never do.,Barney
6144,And it started out as an innocent modeling job.,Robin
6145,It always does.,Barney
6146,Oh my God.,Ted
6147,"Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock.",Barney
6148,What the hell was that?,Robin
6149,"I slap bet Marshall that you did p*rn, so I win.",Ted
6150,"p*rn? I wish it was p*rn, it would be less embarrassing.",Robin
6151,I was a teenage pop star in Canada.,Robin
6152,This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.,Lily
6153,That's you?,Marshall
6154,Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.,Robin
6155,This is the 90's. Why does it look like 1986?,Marshall
6156,The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93.,Robin
6157,"Taking a break from the first of many viewings, I can't help but notice that this isn't p*rn.",Marshall
6158,And yet a slap occurred without the permission of the Slap Bet Commissioner.,Lily
6159,Looks like someone suffered from premature slapulation,Marshall
6160,"Oh my God, Robin's rapping. Guys, Robin's rapping.",Ted
6161,"OK, I'm going to give you a choice. Either ten slaps right now in a row or five slaps that can be doled at any point from here to eternity.",Lily
6162,Go with the 10 now.,Ted
6163,"No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?",Robin
6164,"Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.",Ted
6165,I'm gonna go with the five for eternity.,Barney
6166,Good call.,Robin
6167,Horrible call.,Ted
6168,"Relax, dude, I'm just going for my soda, man. Take it easy. This is gonna be fun.",Marshall
6169,"So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?",Lily
6170,"Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin: I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket.",Barney
6171,"Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone.",Ted
6172,"You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice.",Robin
6173,That's one.,Marshall
6174,Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin: Yes.,Barney
6175,The robot! Hey!,Marshall
6176,"No, she doesn't wanna wait.",Ted
6177,Hi. Have you met me?,Barney
6178,"Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?",Barney
6179,Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change.,Marshall
6180,- And not be groped!,Lily
6181,"Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?",Barney
6182,Right. (he hangs up end takes the other call)- Hello?,Ted
6183,Sex is fun.,Barney
6184,Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count.,Lily
6185,We accept.,Marshall
6186,"Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal.",Marshall
6187,I can't go. I've got this thing.,Barney
6188,"One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,",Robin
6189,That's right. I saw it with my sister.,Ted
6190,"...Dary! Legendary! Dude, I am so excited that you're single again. We're going to conquer New York City. I already have a girl from work lined up for you. Right boob bigger than the left boob, which some choose to look at as bra half empty. I choose to look at as bra half full.",Barney
6191,I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready.,Ted
6192,When will you be ready?,Barney
6193,"Ted Mosby, suit up, 'cause here's the plan. There's a Miss Nassau County pageant. We'll pretend to be judges and, yes, our votes are for sale.",Barney
6194,I'm not ready.,Ted
6195,Finish line of a woman 10K. Salty girls on an endorphin high who just want to lie down. Yeah.,Barney
6196,I'm not ready.,Ted
6197,Female acrobats from Montreal. Super flexible. We're going to get &quot;Cirque de So-Laid&quot;. What up?,Barney
6198,"Barney, come on, we've covered this.",Ted
6199,Robin!,Lily
6200,"Hey, guys. I just got in last night. Um, uh, this is Gael.",Robin
6201,"Okay, I'm ready.",Ted
6202,"I just can't believe her. (He walks into the room with only his chin shaved) We have this totally amicable split, everything's cool. And she comes back from vacation with THAT guy? You know what she's doing? She's trying to win the breakup.",Ted
6203,"What do you mean &quot;Win the breakup&quot;, old timey inventor.",Lily
6204,"What our 21st president, Chester A. Arthur, is trying to say is that in every breakup there are winners and losers.",Marshall
6205,"It's not a competition. Now, your 80-day ballon race around the world, that was a competition.",Lily
6206,That's my wife.,Marshall
6207,"Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name?",Barney
6208,"I'm sorry, Gayle?",Ted
6209,Kyle?,Barney
6210,Girl?,Marshall
6211,It's pronounced &quot;guy-el&quot;.,Robin
6212,I'm sorry. So it's Gayle?,Ted
6213,(With only a mustache now) What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent.,Ted
6214,"That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner.",Barney
6215,"And, oh, he is a masseuse.",Ted
6216,"One time I used warm water to make a guy pee. Of course, I didn't make a career out of it.",Ted
6217,"How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me.",Barney
6218,Not possible. You cannot have sex on a windsurfing board.,Barney
6219,How do you know?,Lily
6220,"Glad you asked Lily. I have crafted a list of every vehicle land-based, aquatic and airborne in which/on which it's possible to have sex. And of those 33 vehicles, I have had sex in/on 31. Windsurfing board, not on the list, not possible. Oh, P.S., in order to hit 33, all I need is bobsled and the Apollo 11 space capsule.",Barney
6221,"To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian.",Lily
6222,This conversation never happened.,Barney
6223,"All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing.",Ted
6224,Yes!,Barney
6225,"You guys, have fun of your duble date.",Ted
6226,"Oh, for the hundredth time, I'm sorry, there was a lull.",Lily
6227,"Do you want to have diner with me? Uh, us?",Lily
6228,There was no lull. You just think he's incredibly hot.,Marshall
6229,"No, I don't!...Not incredibly. It's a little hard to believe how hot is he. But I mean, she isn't serious about him. The girl never marries the hot guy.",Lily
6230,"Well, you did.",Marshall
6231,I'm one of the lucky few.,Lily
6232,"Lily, Ted is our best friend, so let's get something straight: Male Gayle is not hot. He's not our friend. Don't even look at him. Just... no eye contact.",Marshall
6233,"Hey, Robin. (Looks down) Gael.",Lily
6234,I just want to make sure you're okay with this.,Robin
6235,"&quot;I just want to make sure you're okay with this&quot;? Damn it! I can't believe she's the one that gest to say that. She's winning, isn't she?",Ted
6236,"Hum-hum. Not for long. Okay, pep talk. Take a knee. Ted, tonight, we're going to get you someone way hotter than Robin. Okay, Robin's a ten. Fine we'll get you a 12. Or, you know... two sixes. Failing that, four threes. And break glass in case of emergency we'll go the Staten Island, I'll get you 12 ones. Ted, my boy, I'm going to re-teach you... Ah.",Barney
6237,Ted.,Ted
6238,"Barney. Ted, we are back. Up here. Up high. Fivin' it up five-style!",Barney
6239,Weird? Why would it be weird? Because you used to date our best friend or because my wife thinks your new boyfriend is incredibly hot?,Marshall
6240,"I do not! Shut up! Oh, my God!",Lily
6241,I just hope Ted's okay.,Robin
6242,Hmm.,Marshall
6243,"Gael, are you properly licensed massage therapist?",Marshall
6244,Are you legally certified by some type of gouverning entity?,Marshall
6245,Is the card laminated?,Marshall
6246,Covered in protective plastic.,Marshall
6247,Damn it! (To Lily) He checks out...,Marshall
6248,Ted. Ted. Ted. Ted. Ted.,Barney
6249,What?!!,Ted
6250,"Let's bail, this place is dead.",Barney
6251,"Yeah, you're right. We're both totally striking out.",Ted
6252,"Yes, exactly, plus, we're on a tight schedule. I've got the entire evening perfectly planned out... Spoiler alert: Our last stop is an after hours club so after hours, it's three days from now. What up?",Barney
6253,Are you blind? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning.,Ted
6254,Yeah. But I didn't get to help.,Barney
6255,So you're saying you want me to throw away a super hot girl just because you didn't help me get her?,Ted
6256,Apology accepted. Let's go.,Barney
6257,"Hum. This is Barney. Barney, Amy.",Ted
6258,"I'm not gonna remember that. Now, if you'll excuse me, random chick from earlier tonight, as you shall henceforth be known. Ted and I have a schedule to keep.",Barney
6259,"Wow. Wow. Great stuff, Tommy Lee. See what you don't understand is, I'm Ted wingman. It's a sacred bond, much stronger that any... They're making out again!",Barney
6260,"Massage therapist. And you know what, &quot;Gayle&quot;? Your piece of chicken looks a little tense to me. Oh, oh, does that feel good, Mr. Chicken? Well, guess what? I didn't wash my hands. Got him.",Marshall
6261,Lily?!,Marshall
6262,"Oh, I forgive you, Mom.",Lily
6263,"Lily, we are Ted's best friends. Our job is to hate that guy.",Marshall
6264,"Oh, yeah, that's what I was doing. I was building him up so few minutes later, I could totally cut him down.",Lily
6265,Weren't you wearing a bra?,Marshall
6266,They know us here! You're gonna get us in trouble.,Barney
6267,"You... your vagina... Ted, this chick is crazy. We're leaving.",Barney
6268,"Your place? Thanks, but no thanks, 1994 Courtney Love.",Barney
6269,"Okay, this place is actually pretty nice.",Barney
6270,I like your tatts.,Ted
6271,"No, your tatts... toos. Your tattoos.",Ted
6272,"Wrong. Ted has a classic clean-cut look that never goes out of style season after season, burn.",Barney
6273,"No, he wouldn't.",Barney
6274,"No, he wouldn't.",Barney
6275,Nuh-uh.,Barney
6276,Ted. Who are you gonna side with on this tattoos thing?,Barney
6277,I think I'd look way hot with some ink.,Ted
6278,Yeah.,Ted
6279,"Unfair? I wouldn't let you take care of the imaginary kids I make up to score with single moms. That's it Ted, we're going home. Ted? Ted, you okay?",Barney
6280,"And I just want to make sure you're okay with this. (Both laugh) Okay, how do we do this?",Robin
6281,"Okay, how 'bout if I, um...",Robin
6282,"I'm okay. In fact, here's how okay I am. I'm gettin' a tattoo.",Ted
6283,"You're not getting a tattoo. It's not you. Ted, you are heading down a dark path.",Barney
6284,That dark path is my driveway.,Ted
6285,But you need a plan and you need a wingman!,Barney
6286,This is so going in my blog!,Barney
6287,Okay.,Barney
6288,"After this maybe. Oh, man, this is going to be legen... wait for it...",Ted
6289,"Hey, buddy, how was your night?",Marshall
6290,"You know, it was great. I met this crazy girl, I almost got a tattoo. Don't worry, I didn't. But it was... It was amazing. I think it's safe to say, I am winning this breakup.",Ted
6291,Look.,Lily
6292,Oh my God!,Marshall
6293,What?,Ted
6294,Nothing. This J. Crew catalog. Who brings two golden retrievers in a canoe?,Marshall
6295,We've gotta call Barney.,Lily
6296,Way ahead of you.,Marshall
6297,"Hey, guys, what's the big emergency? Oh and B the W: I am never speaking to Ted again.",Barney
6298,"Hum. Really, never? Not even if, say, butterflies flew out of his ass?",Lily
6299,What?,Barney
6300,Hum. Ted? Could you grab me the fondue pot?,Marshall
6301,(To Barney) He has no idea. (Barney falls backward) And up we go.,Marshall
6302,Thank you.,Marshall
6303,Hum. Hum. What?,Ted
6304,Ted?,Barney
6305,Hmm?,Ted
6306,I came here this morning because... I want to apologize.,Barney
6307,"Apology accepted, Barney. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter.",Ted
6308,"See. All this time, I thought you need a wingman to fly, but the truth is you... you've got your own wings now.",Barney
6309,Hmm.,Ted
6310,"Since you and Robin split, you've been gestating. Growing in your cocoon. And last night... you burst out of that cocoon..., like a majestic, uh... gosh, what is it that comes out of a cocoon? I was always bad at science.",Barney
6311,He's gonna say it.,Lily
6312,A butterfly? (Everyone laughs) What?,Ted
6313,"Nothing, buddy.",Barney
6314,Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God! (Looks in mirror) I have a tattoo.,Ted
6315,"Oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp.",Barney
6316,Tramp stamp?,Ted
6317,"You know, a ho tat. Ass antlers. A Panama City license plate.",Barney
6318,What a wuss. Do you think exes can be friends?,Ted
6319,"Hey, your name is Steve. And her ex-boyfriend's name is Steve. What are the odds of that...? Wait.",Ted
6320,No no no no no no no. Give me this.,Ted
6321,"Oh, yeah, that'll get it out.",Barney
6322,Maybe you should try club soda.,Marshall
6323,"Oh, damn it, it really hurts. I need like, some ointment or something. What is this? Spanish massage oil. Spanish massage oil? What happened here last night?",Ted
6324,Last night got weird.,Marshall
6325,Think I just got over being chunky in the ninth grade.,Marshall
6326,I am beautiful.,Marshall
6327,"We're sorry, Ted. It'll never happen again.",Marshall
6328,It meant nothing to us. It just felt really really really good.,Lily
6329,I can't even look at you two right now.,Ted
6330,Ted.,Marshall
6331,He got a tramp stamp. (Everyone laughs),Lily
6332,Okay.,Robin
6333,"Good. Now, here's the thing. It sucks that you came back from Argentina with someone as awesome as Gael. And I know I have no right to be upset at you. We're broken up, life goes on, whatever. But you know what? We-we never did this. We-we had this polite breakup with no irrational yelling and that's just wrong. So I'm gonna yell irrationally for a while and you're just gonna have to stand there and deal with it, okay?",Ted
6334,"If you feel like you need to do that, then...",Robin
6335,"(yells) I think I do! I really think I do! So now, I'm yelling!",Ted
6336,You shaved.,Robin
6337,(yells) I did.,Ted
6338,I like the beard.,Robin
6339,"(still yelling) I liked it too, but it was getting kind of hot. Maybe in the winter, I'll grow it back out! (quietly) Okay, I'm done.",Ted
6340,I know it was weird showing up with Gael. I'm sorry.,Robin
6341,"Look, us breaking up, it was the right thing. But it took some time to get over you, you know? I-I'm still getting over you. But you, you were over it the minute they started the in-flight movie.",Ted
6342,"Over it? My first three days in Argentina, I cried my eyes out. I missed you so much. I wanted to go and prove how adventurous I am, but the truth is, it was really lonely. And that's why Gael happened.",Robin
6343,You weren't trying to win the break-up?,Ted
6344,I was trying to survive it.,Robin
6345,"Okay. No. See, look, that all sounds good, and we'll still be friends and move on, but..., did he have to be so hot? The guy's an Adonis.",Ted
6346,He's not an Adonis.,Robin
6347,He's the Cadillac of rebound guys. Marshall has a crush on him. The guy's perfect.,Ted
6348,He's not perfect.,Robin
6349,"Oh, come on. He's hot, he windsurfs, he massages things. Name one way I'm better than that guy.",Ted
6350,&quot;You're bigger&quot;.,Robin
6351,"Don't patronize me. If anything, he may even be a little bit taller.",Ted
6352,"No, Ted... &quot;you're bigger&quot;.",Robin
6353,Go for Barney.,Barney
6354,"Hey, man. It's Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something.",Marshall
6355,What is it?,Barney
6356,Just a new website. Slapcountdown.com.,Marshall
6357,What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...?,Barney
6358,No. (screams) No!,Barney
6359,"So, beeing married, different? Not different?",Ted
6360,"It's the same. Mostly, except I think I might be getting carpal tunnel. My hands keeps cramping up.",Marshall
6361,I think the whole point of getting married was that you didn't have to do that anymore.,Barney
6362,"No, it's from writing all the thank you notes. Mostly.",Marshall
6363,"Yeah. You're writing constantly. There's forms we have to sign, our death folders, thank you notes...",Lily
6364,Whoa. Whoa. What are death folders?,Barney
6365,It's this thing they recommend you do in case one spouse died unexpectedly.,Lily
6366,It's all the information your spouse might need all in one convenient location.,Marshall
6367,"Yeah. Account info, important addresses, a letter to the other person, all that stuff. I'll get the next round.",Lily
6368,Thanks.,Ted
6369,I am such a jerk.,Marshall
6370,"Yeah. Wait, why?",Barney
6371,I didn't know that I was supposed to write a letter. All Lily's gonna find in that folder are a bunch of bank statements and a funny list of things to do with my ashes.,Marshall
6372,Marshall brownies.,Ted
6373,"Number six. Yeah. Oh, God, I am a bad husband. No, uh, no, I'll just write, I'll write Lily a letter tonight, everything'll be fine.",Marshall
6374,"That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen.",Barney
6375,"Yes! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter.",Ted
6376,"No way at all. In fact, I dare God to smite down this perfectly healthy...",Barney
6377,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! I get it, okay, you guys know I'm a little superstitious, and you guys are trying to freak me out. Well, guess what? It didn't work. So, there.",Marshall
6378,You guys are jerks!,Marshall
6379,"I was just so uptight in New York, you know? I mean, down here everybody shares everything. It's like we're all one big shimmering ball of positive energy. I wonder if anyone's ever thought that before.",Robin
6380,A drum circle! They're different every time. Let's go watch!,Robin
6381,And here I am at the drum circle.,Robin
6382,"Whoa. Are you topless? Ted, check this out.",Barney
6383,Seen 'em.,Ted
6384,Wow. It seems like a great trip.,Lily
6385,"Oh, it was. I feel like the Robin who left is not the same Robin who came back, you know.",Robin
6386,Wow. There's a lot of nude people in here.,Lily
6387,"You haven't changed, Scherbatsky. You're a sophisticated, scotch-swilling, cigar-smoking, red-meat-eating, g*n new yorker.",Barney
6388,Just shoes and a shirt. That's a look.,Lily
6389,"What you are not is a massage-giving, windsurfing, bongo-playing, teetotaling, vegan, peacenik, hippy like you soon to be ex-boyfriend, Gael. Back me up here, Ted.",Barney
6390,I'm just happy Robin's happy.,Ted
6391,Thank you.,Robin
6392,"Man, this is like &quot;Where's Waldo&quot; of exposed genitalia. Except that it's really easy to find Waldo.",Lily
6393,"I'm evolved, and I'm enjoying living my life a little bit closer to the way Gael and I did in Argentina.",Robin
6394,"Please, vacation romances have an expiration date. Gael's got a &quot;Best if banged by&quot; sticker on him. Once your romance starts to stink, you'll dump his ass down the drain like sour milk and go back to being &quot;Unevolved Robin&quot;, the one we actually like. Back me up here, Ted.",Barney
6395,I'm just happy Robin's happy.,Ted
6396,"I'm telling you, within three days...",Barney
6397,"Ooh, here he comes. Switched to big words.",Lily
6398,"Within a triad of solar periods, you'll recognize your dearth of compatibility with your paramour and conclude your association.",Barney
6399,My journey was transformative and I reassert my commitment to both the aforementioned paramour and the philosophies he espouses.[/b],Robin
6400,"This is all gonna returns to masticate you in the gluteals. Support my hypotehesis, Ted.",Barney
6401,I'm just jubilant my former paramour's jubilant.,Ted
6402,That guy...,Barney
6403,Yeah. That guy. Look at how easy he has it.,Ted
6404,"Well. You and me, we have to bend over backwards to get a woman to, well, bend over backwards. But that guy... every woman in the bar is hanging on his every slightly mispronounced word. And why?",Barney
6405,He's better looking than us.,Ted
6406,No. Because he's from out of town.,Barney
6407,Mmm.,Ted
6408,"Yeah. Plus a*t*matic out, you're leaving in a couple of days. God, I wish we were tourists.",Ted
6409,Yeah. Actually... You know where I've been meaning to visit?,Barney
6410,"Okay, okay. We're from a small town in the south of France. Our plane leaves sunday morning.",Ted
6411,"(With southern accent) Uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies. Hate to bother you. We seem to be a little bit lost. Would you happen to know which street the statue of liberty's on?",Barney
6412,Oh.,Ted
6413,"Oh, it's right. And, thank you very... Uh, my name is, uh, Ignatius Peabody Nobel, from East Westerton, Missouri. And this is my friend... Ted.",Barney
6414,"Hi, Colleen.",Barney
6415,"Hi, Lindsay.",Barney
6416,"So, hey, you-you ladies, been awful nice to us. What do you say... ah, never mind. No...",Ted
6417,"Well, it's just we're leaving sunday morning. It sure would be nice to have some real New Yorkers show us around.",Ted
6418,Yeah.,Barney
6419,Well. Hotdog! Should we... you want to just meet here in front of Mac... MacLaren's pub?,Barney
6420,Really? It doesn't seem that lame to me.,Ted
6421,I think it's cool.,Ted
6422,All right.,Barney
6423,(yelling)I'm just saying it seems like a kind of bar a lot of cool people would hang out there.,Ted
6424,Okay. All right.,Barney
6425,"So, Gael, huh?",Lily
6426,Mmm.,Robin
6427,Still going strong?,Lily
6428,"Yeah. It's great. Amazing, fantastic, awesome.",Robin
6429,"Ooh, that's one too many. What's going on?",Lily
6430,"Well, now that I'm home, I'm finding myself getting annoyed at things that I loved on vacation.",Robin
6431,"Oh, so good.",Robin
6432,"Ooh sofa! Ooh sofa! Sofa, sofa, oh... ooh (she grunts)",Robin
6433,Ooh.,Robin
6434,Laptop! Laptop! Laptop! (She sighs when the laptop fall over),Robin
6435,"And you know what else? I'm still finding sand everywhere. I mean, we haven't been to the beach since Argentina. Where is all coming from?",Robin
6436,"Well, maybe you're just going back to the person you were before the trip.",Lily
6437,"But I don't want to. I was so happy down there. No, you know what? I'm done complaining. I'm evolving. Just gonna go with the flow.",Robin
6438,"Wow. Gael, you're peeing while I'm in the shower. Okay. Okay, old Robin would have been like, dude, ocupado. But now, you know what, I'm cool with it. Pee it up. In fact, when you're done, why won't you come in here and join me?",Robin
6439,"Gael, there's some weird du.. (A lot of people is on her apartment) Hello.",Robin
6440,Wow. Both sides. You wrote on both sides of a thank you note to my third cousin for a blender that you haven't even taken out of the box.,Marshall
6441,"Wow, it's a really nice blender.",Lily
6442,"Well, if you love that blender so much, why don't you just marry it.",Marshall
6443,I can't. I married you. That's how we got the blender. What's wrong?,Lily
6444,"Nothing. Nothing's wrong. What could be wrong? Except that when you die, I'm gonna find out that your parting words to comfort me for all eternity were &quot;Cancel Vogue&quot;.",Marshall
6445,How can you open my letter?,Lily
6446,"That was not a letter. It was barely even a text message. Next time you write something that short, at least have the courtesy to make it rhyme.",Marshall
6447,"Marshall, wait. (He opens the door) This was our first fight as a married couple.",Lily
6448,"Oh, baby.",Marshall
6449,Oh.,Lily
6450,"Yes, I'm sure this is the best of their 57 &quot;spudtacular&quot; east coast locations.",Ted
6451,"This is the easiest date ever. You know what I'm gonna try next? A knock, knock joke.",Barney
6452,Easiest? Somehow we have managed to find the two lamest new yorkers of all time.,Ted
6453,"Ted, Ted, Ted. Dude.",Barney
6454,I'm looking at you. What?,Ted
6455,Right. Stay with me. We are on the cusp of moving from out-of-towners to in-their-pantsers. Ay-o?,Barney
6456,"All right, Ignatius, one more hour.",Ted
6457,"Nice. (The girls are coming in) Nice. Hey, nice.",Barney
6458,"Knock, knock.",Barney
6459,"Yes, we do.",Barney
6460,"Quick announcement. I am so glad that you're here, fellow travelers. A couple rules... not even rules. Let's call them guidelines for harmonious living. Guideline for harmonious living number one ; The kitchen sink is for dishes, the toilet is for pee-pee. G.F.H.L. number two ; Marijuana is illegal in the United States, even when baked into a blueberry muffin that someone might mistakenly eat for breakfast right before they leave for their job as a TV Newscaster. &quot;This just in: Look at my hand, how weird is my hand?&quot; is not an appropriate thing to say on the air. And number three... I... (All cherring). (Yelling) And number three is please keep the noise to a minimum. I have to take a nap. I'm still pretty baked.",Robin
6461,"Everything's so bright, even at night. No wonder the city never sleeps. (Barney and Colleen laughing)",Barney
6462,"Hey. If we're going north, why did we cross over the FDR? We should have taken the Hudson.",Ted
6463,"(scoffing) Now he knows all the streets. Someone's been watching too many &quot;Steinfield reruns&quot;. (Woman laughing, Ted laughts sarcastically)",Barney
6464,Where are we even going anyway?,Ted
6465,A hundred... on the south of Bronx at this time of night? We're going to get k*ll.,Ted
6466,"Ted. I think these local new yorkers know more about the city than we do, so relax. We're in very capable hands.",Barney
6467,"There were three of them, at least two g*n... they took all our money.",Ted
6468,Well. I only had traveler's checks.,Barney
6469,"Hey, babe. I've been thinking about our fight.",Marshall
6470,Yes?,Lily
6471,"I'm really, really... surprised that you haven't apologized to me yet.",Marshall
6472,"Wow. You really want to open this up again. Oh, I forgot, you open everything up, even if you're not supposed to until I'm dead.",Lily
6473,You know that is important to me. Why won't you just write the letter?,Marshall
6474,"Because, I can't bear the thought of not being with you, not even for long enough to write you a stupid letter.",Lily
6475,Really?,Marshall
6476,"Yes, really. Plus, I know as soon as I write it, you're just going to open it up and read it again.",Lily
6477,"Lily, I won't, I promise.",Marshall
6478,Okay. I'll write you a letter for my death folder.,Lily
6479,"Do you mind, um, maybe slipping in a little bit of dirty stuff, too?",Marshall
6480,I tell you what. How about I make it all dirty stuff and slip in a little clean stuff?,Lily
6481,You're the best. And maybe a couple polaroids?,Marshall
6482,What?! This night couldn't have gone any better. We've just survived a mugging. You know what that means.,Barney
6483,"&quot;Thank God, we're alive&quot; sex.",Ted
6484,"&quot;Thank God we're alive&quot; sex. It's even better than &quot;I can't believe you just proposed to me&quot; sex, which I've only had, like, four of five times. Ted, please, we are so close.",Barney
6485,All right. I'm in. I've never worked this hard for anything in my life.,Ted
6486,Whew.,Ted
6487,Mmm-mm. Me too. So where do you live?,Barney
6488,What? West village?,Ted
6489,West Orange? New Jersey?,Ted
6490,"You guys live in New Jersey, not New York?",Ted
6491,Theodore.,Barney
6492,New Jersey?,Ted
6493,Teddy?,Barney
6494,"Oh, no. Oh, no.",Ted
6495,"Oh, no.",Barney
6496,New Jersey is not &quot;pretty much New York&quot;. You are not &quot;pretty much new yorkers&quot;.,Ted
6497,"Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to &quot;pretty much New York&quot;? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey!",Ted
6498,"(with an accent) You're not from Missouri? Well, I will be a monkey's unc...",Barney
6499,"Hey, um, sir, can we get ride, too?",Barney
6500,Can you please keep it down?,Robin
6501,Well. I have to have a job.,Robin
6502,I'm canadian. You know that.,Robin
6503,Wow. I just realized something.,Robin
6504,"No, that you really suck. You're boring and lame and you're getting sand everywhere. Seriously, where is all the sand coming from? You're not the real me. All you are is me on vacation trying to get away from a break-up.",Robin
6505,What are you doing?,Robin
6506,"All right, everyone out! I said everyone out!",Robin
6507,(yelling) I'm canadian!,Robin
6508,"No, I'm not. Listen, Gael, I need to talk to you about something.",Robin
6509,"Welcome home, Scherbatsky.",Barney
6510,"Oh, good to be back. Although it's weird, vacation Robin popped into my dream again last night.",Robin
6511,Listening.,Barney
6512,This time we went all the way. Tell you one thing. She is maybe sandy but that chick knows what I like.,Robin
6513,"Okay, I'm done... but I really don't want you reading this unless... you know, something happens. Can you swear to me you won't open it?",Lily
6514,Totally. What does it say?,Marshall
6515,"Marshall, I'm serious.",Lily
6516,"Okay. I promise I won't, I won't open that until you're dead.",Marshall
6517,Okay.,Lily
6518,That's it? I suck. Lily.,Marshall
6519,"Yes, you suck. You said you wouldn't read it and you did.",Lily
6520,"Well, you didn't keep your promise either. I don't see any dirty pictures in here.",Marshall
6521,"Oh, fine, I'll take the dirty pictures.",Lily
6522,I don't want 'em now.,Marshall
6523,What is that supposed to mean?,Lily
6524,What?! Nothing. Nothing. You're beautiful. I would love the photos. Have I told you how beautiful you look?,Marshall
6525,Oh my God. Barney...oh my God.,Ted
6526,"Use your words, Ted.",Barney
6527,"OK. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.",Ted
6528,The belt?,Barney
6529,The belt.,Ted
6530,But that's impossible. You were up here less than half an hour ago.,Barney
6531,"Yes, advantage Ericksen.",Marshall
6532,Don't get cocky. Wimbledon lasts a fortnight.,Barney
6533,"Fortnight. British words are so cool. Plus, did you know lawyers there get to wear wigs? I wear a wig to work, I'm a jackass.",Marshall
6534,"All right, I'm ready, let's hit it.",Ted
6535,Can't go. Tournament.,Marshall
6536,"What? We agreed, I suited up.",Ted
6537,You take too long to get ready,Barney
6538,"What are you talking about? I got the low-maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look.",Ted
6539,"Yeah, which takes an hour and a half of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.",Marshall
6540,And then he starts on his hair. Ace.,Barney
6541,"Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not?",Ted
6542,"Just go without us, we'll be there in five minutes.",Barney
6543,Really?,Ted
6544,"All right, going down to the bar and ordering three beers, I'll see you in five minutes.",Ted
6545,"(holding up appropriate number of fingers) 3 beers, 5 minutes.",Ted
6546,Thanks for lending me these boots. Where did you get them from?,Robin
6547,"Oh, this store in the Village had one of those crazy sales. It was a footwear feeding frenzy.",Lily
6548,I saw it first.,Lily
6549,"You just made the list, bitch.",Lily
6550,"So many questions. Firstly, what do you think would happen if a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots?",Barney
6551,"You look fantastic in them, Robin. But don't you think they're a little high for that dress?",Lily
6552,"Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've g*n a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave.",Robin
6553,"FYI, it doesn't matter, baby. Guys just wanna get on the green. They don't mind going through the rough.",Barney
6554,Shekwakie.,Marshall
6555,Stinson.,Barney
6556,"All right, the beers are here.",Ted
6557,"Yeah, we're not gonna make it.",Barney
6558,"Oh come on, we agreed...Did Marshall take his pants off?",Ted
6559,"Yeah, pants are off.",Barney
6560,"This is Wimbledon, Ted. I need the freedom and mobility that only underwear can provide. Cheerio.",Marshall
6561,"Fine, I don't need friends. I got you guys. You guys are my friends, my cold refreshing friends. I'm talking to beer.",Ted
6562,"Trudy. Oh my God, I haven't seen you since...",Ted
6563,That was you? Kidding. I was super wasted... that night. These are not all for me.,Ted
6564,"No, I was gonna call you but I was so embarrassed.",Ted
6565,"Those were yours? I thought they felt kinda tight. Kidding, I don't wear underwear, ladies underwear. Often. Again, I'm kidding.",Ted
6566,"I know, do you wanna get a...",Ted
6567,"Let me guess, you guys met in prison.",Ted
6568,"Well, beers, what do you want to do? Stay here, or I know this other place called my belly.",Ted
6569,"Oh, that's cool, I was gonna get outta here anyway, I'm really tired.",Ted
6570,Tired of people who fold early 'cause I am wide awake.,Ted
6571,"OK, guys, be cool.",Ted
6572,"Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean.",Marshall
6573,That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.,Barney
6574,Stinson.,Barney
6575,"I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident.",Ted
6576,"You mean, the girl who chalked your pool cue and snuck down the fire escape.",Barney
6577,"So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive.",Ted
6578,So you now have two on the line?,Barney
6579,And I don't know which one to go for.,Ted
6580,Go for the new girl.,Barney
6581,"Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove.",Barney
6582,New girl? What new girl?,Lily
6583,Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections and I think...,Barney
6584,"Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. Give it to me.",Lily
6585,Are they friends? (Ted on phone),Lily
6586,"Yeah. No, I don't know. They're old sorority sisters.",Ted
6587,Are they Betas?,Lily
6588,Because they're all sluts and you can tell them right now I didn't wanna be in their sorority anyway.,Lily
6589,"They're Kappas and I think I can score with one of them. I don't know which one and if I choose wrong, I lose 'em both.",Ted
6590,"OK, well, don't worry, I'll come down and help you figure it out.",Lily
6591,I thought we were in for the evening.,Marshall
6592,"That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there but I guess we're both wrong, governor.",Barney
6593,"Well, that's very complicated.",Ted
6594,"Oh, somebody should lock you girls up.",Ted
6595,(muttering to himself) I am never not wearing a suit again.,Ted
6596,Hello.,Ted
6597,"It's me, I'm at the bar. Don't look, just call me mom.",Lily
6598,"Hi Mom, how's dad's colon?",Ted
6599,"What? What's the matter with you? Anyway, both of these girls are into you. Take your pick.",Lily
6600,They are? Are you sure?,Ted
6601,"Yes, of course. They're playing with their hair and touching your arm. Class green light.",Lily
6602,Are you positive?,Ted
6603,That is so fascinating. So what happened?,Robin
6604,"Wow, gosh, separating conjoined twins. That must be the most amazing feeling.",Robin
6605,That is so funny. You are so funny.,Robin
6606,"Positive. They both want you bad. It's a clearance sale and you're the boots, baby.",Lily
6607,"Oh, it's Robin. Good luck.",Lily
6608,Bye mom.,Ted
6609,My mom.,Ted
6610,Hello.,Lily
6611,Bring me a razor.,Robin
6612,What about the no-shave rule? What happened to your convictions?,Lily
6613,They've been surgically removed by Dr. Awesome.,Robin
6614,"No, I'm not doing it. The whole point to not shaving...",Lily
6615,"Lily, please, he's really cute and I really like him. And he's got a British accent.",Robin
6616,I'm on my way.,Lily
6617,"So, this college boyfriend, who, who won him?",Ted
6618,"What? What, what were you guys gonna do but never did.",Ted
6619,"Nobody cares, just say it.",Ted
6620,"Well, he's right, it's a dead heat.",Lily
6621,Neither one is giving ground. I could not tell who was the third wheel.,Lily
6622,It's a tricycle.,Ted
6623,"No way, no way, no way!",Barney
6624,What's happening?,Marshall
6625,It's a tricycle.,Ted
6626,"No way, no way, no way. It's a tricycle.",Marshall
6627,"Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts.",Lily
6628,Put him on speaker.,Barney
6629,So what you're saying to us right now is you have a sh*t at the belt?,Barney
6630,"Wait wait wait, what belt?",Marshall
6631,Barney and I have this running joke that the first guy to actually pull this off would win the championship belt.,Ted
6632,"Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt, right?",Marshall
6633,You actually bought a belt.,Ted
6634,"That's right, it's resplendent.",Barney
6635,"It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around.",Ted
6636,"I never kid. Remember you said if I ever slept with that girl from Days of our Lives, I'd be the king? Well...",Barney
6637,Why wasn't I told about the belt? I could go for the belt.,Marshall
6638,"If Lily were to die before me, then I could ride the tricycle.",Marshall
6639,"If I died, I'd just come back and haunt your penis.",Lily
6640,"Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?",Ted
6641,"All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?",Barney
6642,Yes.,Ted
6643,"Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds.",Barney
6644,Yes.,Ted
6645,"Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women?",Barney
6646,What? No.,Ted
6647,Ted?,Barney
6648,"No. Look, I gotta go. They're gonna think I inherited my dad's imaginary bathroom issues.",Ted
6649,"Oh, are you guys leaving?",Ted
6650,"Right, well...",Ted
6651,"Great, I have it right upstairs. It's in my apartment upstairs. Let's so upstairs.",Ted
6652,That's funny. I love that. You should tell more jokes at my apartment upstairs.,Ted
6653,"Scenario number 12. We're in a horrific car crash, you die, I'm left paralyzed. Two sexy nurses with a six-pack of wine coolers sneak into my room late at night. I try to blink at them in morse code, &quot;Please, don't, I love my dead wife,&quot; but they're medical professionals and I gotta think somehow they're saving my life.",Marshall
6654,"Fine, sleep with your nurses. Tonight you ride the unicycle.",Lily
6655,I already did this morning.,Marshall
6656,Hello.,Lily
6657,"Lily, I have pounded three cappuccinos waiting for you. Pretty soon I won't have to shave, the hair is going to vibrate off my legs.",Robin
6658,"Sorry, I can't leave now.",Lily
6659,"Lily, he can't see my legs like this. I look like a Turkish lesbian",Robin
6660,There is a pharmacy across the street. Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?,Robin
6661,"Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me. (reading text) We're combing upsars.",Barney
6662,We're combing upsars? What does that mean?,Marshall
6663,He's coming upstairs!,Lily
6664,Where are my pants? Where's my pants!,Marshall
6665,Got 'em.,Ted
6666,"Yes, yes, but they are not here. They are somewhere else. We have total privacy because privacy is essential when you're listening to music.",Ted
6667,That's hilarious. You are hilarious. I'll go get it in my bedroom. The CD's in my bedroom. Bedroom.,Ted
6668,This is gonna be awesome.,Ted
6669,No!,Ted
6670,"What are you guys doing here? I've got, I've got...",Ted
6671,"We know, we know, Ted. Well done, this is very impressive. Up top.",Lily
6672,"Yeah bro, up top.",Marshall
6673,"Oh, don't be gross.",Lily
6674,"You guys need to get out of here right now. Please, take the fire escape.",Ted
6675,"No, no way. The other day I saw a pigeon take a crap on it and the whole thing shifted.",Marshall
6676,"Oh, you can use our bedroom.",Lily
6677,"OK, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD...Barney.",Ted
6678,What are you doing?,Ted
6679,I cannot allow Ted to do this.,Barney
6680,"Why, why?",Ted
6681,Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom.,Barney
6682,"But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting.",Marshall
6683,"I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.",Barney
6684,"So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?",Barney
6685,I'll get the video camera.,Barney
6686,OK then.,Barney
6687,Let me get this straight. You're gonna trike block me? That is so petty. It's like you're...,Ted
6688,Tom Petty.,Marshall
6689,Tom Petty. You're Tom Petty.,Ted
6690,Where's Lily?,Ted
6691,"Still looking for that CD, so...",Ted
6692,What are you doing?,Ted
6693,I knew it. I had a hunch about that girl and I was right.,Lily
6694,I saw it first.,Lily
6695,"You just made the list, bitch.",Lily
6696,"I cannot give up my bedroom to a boot thief. She should be punished, not rewarded.",Lily
6697,"Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me.",Ted
6698,"No, never.",Lily
6699,"What if I reimburse you for the boots, full retail?",Ted
6700,"Thanks, enjoy our bedroom.",Lily
6701,"OK, take it.",Ted
6702,Wish me luck.,Ted
6703,Oh my God.,Barney
6704,Where's the shaving cream?,Robin
6705,"Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream?",Robin
6706,"Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude?",Robin
6707,Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies room. I've got TB...tiny bladder. I'll meet you out front?,Robin
6708,You've gotta be kidding me.,Robin
6709,Excuse me.,Robin
6710,"So, I'm having a little trouble finding the CD.",Ted
6711,Exactly.,Ted
6712,"It's getting late, I'll get your coats.",Ted
6713,"I'll get your coats? Ted: I don't know why I said that. Why did I say that? It's the opposite of what I meant. I wanna take clothes off them, not put more on.",Lily
6714,"Ted, you're ruining this for everyone.",Marshall
6715,Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors sh**t themselves in the foot.,Barney
6716,"What are you talking about? Barney: If you must know, it wasn't a freak beverage malfunction that stopped me from riding the tricycle that night.",Lily
6717,"Oh no, the night's ruined!",Barney
6718,Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?,Barney
6719,Why would you do that to yourself?,Marshall
6720,"Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me.",Barney
6721,"See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?",Ted
6722,"The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn.",Barney
6723,It won't?,Ted
6724,"No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong. (laughs) Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1.",Barney
6725,"Ladies, couldn't find your coats but I did find tequila.",Ted
6726,"Wait, wait wait, a remote control fire place? We don't have a remote control fire place.",Ted
6727,Why would I want to tire them out?,Ted
6728,That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one.,Barney
6729,It's 'cause I used to practice all the time on my grandmother.,Ted
6730,Why in God's name would I say that?,Ted
6731,I was just thinking about this documentary I saw once about something called a supervolcano.,Ted
6732,"OK, what the hell.",Ted
6733,"OK, wait for it.",Barney
6734,"Could happen at any time and obliterate all life on earth, which is why I live by three simple words. Don't postpone joy.",Ted
6735,Yeah.,Ted
6736,"Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this.",Ted
6737,Yes you can.,Barney
6738,"I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I'm actually moved. Bring it in, guys.",Lily
6739,All right.,Ted
6740,I'll see you on the other side.,Ted
6741,"So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it.",Barney
6742,What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.,Barney
6743,"You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?",Barney
6744,"You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me!",Barney
6745,"Some stories you tell, some stories you don't.",Ted
6746,"Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?",Barney
6747,"Ted, belt.",Barney
6748,Did? Tell me. You know if he did it?,Barney
6749,"I'm here, I'm fine, my head is bleeding. Going down again.",Robin
6750,100! We only got to 82 on our honeymoon.,Lily
6751,"So, Robin, I've got a guy for you. He's cute, he's funny, he's smart.",Lily
6752,What's his 'but'?,Ted
6753,What do you mean? Ted: When someone wants to set you up they always tell you the good qualities first but then they leave out their huge flaw.,Lily
6754,She's totally hot and really fun.,Barney
6755,(to himself) But she has a dead tooth.,Barney
6756,She's superhot and she's so successful.,Marshall
6757,(to himself) But she has a pug that she pushes around in a stroller.,Marshall
6758,She's so cute and she's so smart.,Lily
6759,(to herself) But her last boyfriend had to get a restraining order against her and then his cat and new vacuum cleaner both went missing.,Lily
6760,"Wow, set it up.",Ted
6761,I'm still convinced she k*ll my turtle.,Ted
6762,"Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice.",Robin
6763,"If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it!",Barney
6764,"Well, there's nothing wrong with this guy. He's really nice and he's really cute.",Lily
6765,"But? Lily: Fine, but he has a kid.",Ted
6766,Oh.,Marshall
6767,Aha! There it is. Robin's not going out with a guy with a kid.,Ted
6768,"But the guy is really great. And his kid's sweet, he's in my class.",Lily
6769,Doesn't matter. Robin hates kids.,Ted
6770,I don't hate kids.,Robin
6771,"You told me even when you were a kid, you hated kids.",Ted
6772,"OK, yes, kids are not my favorite thing in the world but I like them.",Robin
6773,"Well, you don't wanna have them.",Ted
6774,I like sports cars but it doesn't mean I wanna push a Ferrari through my vagina,Robin
6775,g*n.,Barney
6776,"You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays.",Marshall
6777,Nice.,Barney
6778,"You know what, the kid is not a problem. I wanna meet this guy.",Robin
6779,"OK, that's awesome.",Lily
6780,"Yeah. Hey, what's my 'but'? You know, I'm really nice, but...",Robin
6781,(to himself) But she's afraid of commitment.,Ted
6782,(to herself) But she's a g*n nut.,Lily
6783,(to himself) But she's Canadian.,Barney
6784,(to himself) But she didn't like Field of Dreams.,Marshall
6785,I can't think of anything.,Barney
6786,You don't have a 'but'.,Ted
6787,"OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch.",Barney
6788,Why?,Ted
6789,The ultimate ice breaker.,Barney
6790,"A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year. Suddenly we see these snake bastards sneaking towards a little baby. Not on our watch. You grab the kid, I strangle six cobras with my bare hands. Women of New York, one at a time please.",Barney
6791,"So, what are the eye patches for?",Ted
6792,We got bit.,Barney
6793,On the eye? Barney: Yes.,Ted
6794,Both of us.,Ted
6795,They're different eyes. I don't see why this bugs you. Patch up!,Barney
6796,"OK, here's the thing, George is a great guy, we had a wonderful date.",Robin
6797,But?,Lily
6798,Can't wait to meet him? Why did I say that? I don't wanna meet his kid.,Robin
6799,"Well, you knew you'd meet him sooner or later.",Lily
6800,"I was just hoping for later, like in 20 years when I'm a cougar and he's as hot as his dad.",Robin
6801,"Robin, What's the big deal? He's just a kid. He's not gonna bite. He may bite. We're working on biting.",Lily
6802,Why is this kid around anyway? Shouldn't he be with his mom? What kind of lawyer does this guy have if he has to take care of the kid all the time?,Robin
6803,A good one. He won full custody.,Lily
6804,"He won? He won. Oh God, getting the kid is winning, isn't it?",Robin
6805,Don't tell anyone I said that.,Robin
6806,"OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches.",Ted
6807,"Oh, Theodore...",Barney
6808,"...no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game.",Barney
6809,"Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen.",Ted
6810,Oh yeah? I'm the New York state gaming commissioner.,Barney
6811,"Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.",Ted
6812,Wow.,Barney
6813,Wow. You're here and not in stall two.,Marshall
6814,"Yeah, so?",Ted
6815,I may have made some wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes.,Marshall
6816,"OK, Marshall.",Barney
6817,Yes.,Marshall
6818,Which one of us has more game?,Barney
6819,"Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me.",Marshall
6820,"What? Marshall: If dating is the game, then marriage is winning the game.",Barney
6821,"Yeah, if you're playing in the women's league.",Ted
6822,"You're joking. I have mad game, bra.",Marshall
6823,"OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert.",Barney
6824,"I hate to say it, buddy, but you're kinda' irrelevant.",Ted
6825,What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out.,Marshall
6826,"Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list.",Barney
6827,Do you guys wanna hear one of my lines?,Marshall
6828,"First of all, I did not ask to see that list and I am still horrified. True game is about quality, not quantity. And a quality girl would pick me over you any day.",Ted
6829,Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl.,Marshall
6830,"Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad.",Barney
6831,Fine.,Ted
6832,There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges...,Barney
6833,Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.,Ted
6834,That's good too.,Barney
6835,How about her?,Barney
6836,You're on.,Ted
6837,"Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?",Barney
6838,"OK, great. Rule number one, no eye patches or props of any kind.",Ted
6839,"One time I was with this girl and I tried that model line, and I totally got some over-the-shirt boob action at a Just Say No assembly.",Marshall
6840,Just stop. You're bumming everybody out.,Ted
6841,"Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars.",Ted
6842,I win.,Barney
6843,How?,Ted
6844,"Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot.",Barney
6845,"Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook.",Ted
6846,I can't sleep with her again. She hates me.,Barney
6847,"Oh, Interesting. Look who just took a commanding lead. Now, with you out of the picture, I can take my sweet time.",Ted
6848,"Ted, she's leaving.",Marshall
6849,Get out of my way.,Ted
6850,"By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy.",Barney
6851,Look who's got game.,Marshall
6852,"Only the biggest ever. I think kids are so great. Especially the little ones. You know, uh, pudgy, can't sit up, don't have teeth yet.",Robin
6853,"Yeah, I like that kind.",Robin
6854,"Oh, six is great. You are gonna love six. Six is when they really start to... (Robin nods) I hate kids.",Robin
6855,"Yeah, let's take things slow.",Robin
6856,"Hey, what's up?",Lily
6857,"It's here, Lily. It's looking at me. The kid, what do I do?",Robin
6858,"Just talk to him. You can do this, Robin.",Lily
6859,No it's not. It's actually a type of bird.,Robin
6860,"Dude, I'm just reading my paper.",Robin
6861,Sure.,Robin
6862,It all tastes the same once it's in the bowl.,Robin
6863,Milk first it is.,Robin
6864,"Well, maybe if they weren't such idiots, I wouldn't have to call them that.",Robin
6865,You too.,Robin
6866,"Well, have fun in yoga.",Ted
6867,She's strengthening her core. That's gonna be good.,Ted
6868,"Yeah, all right. After a while, crocodile.",Ted
6869,You see this. Game face.,Ted
6870,"Whatever, Ted.",Barney
6871,"Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that?",Ted
6872,"Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song.",Barney
6873,"I am not irrelevant. I ran the numbers. If Lily and I have sex twice a week, which, let's be honest, we all know is being conservative. And we've been together for ten years plus seventeen more times on the honeymoon. Minus the two week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store reminded me of a young Lily. Then we have had sex a total of...wait for it...",Marshall
6874,Nice.,Barney
6875,"One thousand fifty-three and a half times...my mom called once. But that's more times than Barney has ever had sex and to your point, Ted, Lily is a quality girl. I win. Lawyered.",Marshall
6876,Doesn't count.,Barney
6877,Totally counts.,Marshall
6878,"You're right, it counts. It counts as one. You've had sex once. How was it? Marshall: I still matter.",Ted
6879,"OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know.",Barney
6880,"Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing.",Ted
6881,"We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted: You know what, I don't mind. Barney: No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak.",Barney
6882,"No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going (lowers head slightly and shakes it vigorously) on what I've already gone (lowers head again slightly and shakes it vigorously) on.",Barney
6883,"Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?",Ted
6884,"Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic.",Barney
6885,Fine.,Ted
6886,And I only stirred that with my pinky.,Barney
6887,"Guess who loves Robin? Kids, kids love Robin. Doug thinks I'm pretty cool.",Robin
6888,"Really, that's great. You and George, all thanks to me.",Lily
6889,"Yeah, I'm gonna have to break up with him.",Robin
6890,What?,Lily
6891,"Well, tt's just getting a little bit too serious with the kid. You know, it's just not what I'm looking for. So, better that I break it off now before he gets too attached.",Robin
6892,What?,Robin
6893,"I hate to tell you this but, too late.",Lily
6894,He drew it in class today.,Lily
6895,Oh crap.,Robin
6896,"There's no way that's a picture of me. That woman has on hoop earrings, I don't even own hoop earrings. I have one pair and they're gold. Those are Fruit Loops.",Robin
6897,You are so in denial right now. And you're doing what you always do in relationships.,Lily
6898,We'll ask the guys. They'll tell you that's not me,Robin
6899,That's totally you.,Marshall
6900,You guys are totally crazy.,Robin
6901,"Hey, who drew the picture of Robin?",Ted
6902,It's not me.,Robin
6903,"You're joking, right?",Marshall
6904,It's not me.,Robin
6905,&quot;My new mommy.&quot; Kinda has a nice ring to it.,Ted
6906,"Hey, now that you're a mom, are you gonna start wearing those totally awesome jeans that go right up to your boobs?",Marshall
6907,Do guys really think this is me?,Robin
6908,"Honey, it's you. And if you're gonna break up with George, you have to break up with his kid too.",Lily
6909,Really?,Robin
6910,"Yeah, you can't just abandon him. You have to talk to him. Come on, Robin, you know it's the right thing to do.",Lily
6911,"Man. Doug was right, you are a pain in the ass.",Robin
6912,Me too.,Ted
6913,Mm-hm.,Ted
6914,"Hey, Doug.",Robin
6915,"Actually, I came to see you.",Robin
6916,"Sure, why not?",Robin
6917,"Oh, that is so sweet, Even though it doesn't rhyme.",Robin
6918,"Look, uh, Doug. There's no good way to say this.",Robin
6919,"We need to talk. I just think, um, we both could use some space right now. It's not you, it's me. I know this hurts but you deserve someone better. I'm just really trying to focus on my career right now, you know. I just hope we can still be friends.",Robin
6920,What the hell was that? Doug: That was my new mommy.,Robin
6921,"So, this picture is not of me?",Robin
6922,How many dates has she been on with your dad?,Robin
6923,"Well, I've been on like five and you like her better?",Robin
6924,And what about me? You think I go around pouring cereal for every boy in town.,Robin
6925,"Robin. My name is Robin. Like the bird, remember?",Robin
6926,"So, that's it, huh?",Robin
6927,"Yeah, there's always a 'but'.",Robin
6928,"Well, I couldn't do it. I broke up with her. Thanks a lot by the way. A beautiful, sexy girl and all I could think about was you being there first. You were stuck in my head like a Chumbawumba song.",Ted
6929,"Which Chumbawumba song? Barney: Well, what an interesting turn of events. It looks like I'm going to win.",Marshall
6930,"What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped.",Ted
6931,That's what you think happened.,Barney
6932,"OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any...",Ted
6933,Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend?,Barney
6934,"So now, whatever nice things Ted does for her, in her mind, I'm the guy who's even nicer than him.",Barney
6935,So you never slept with her?,Ted
6936,Not even at all.,Barney
6937,"Wow, that's good.",Marshall
6938,It gets better. Remember Ted's phone conversation?,Barney
6939,"Well., have fun in yoga",Ted
6940,Well?,Barney
6941,Oh.,Barney
6942,"Stacy, right?",Barney
6943,"Yeah, wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here too?",Barney
6944,I'm gonna head out to a reggae concert. I'm a huge fan of reggae.,Barney
6945,"No way, I wonder why Ted didn't tell me about that. Like I said, I'm a huge reggae fan.",Barney
6946,After a while crocodile.,Ted
6947,We are two peas.,Barney
6948,"Wow, take care. Namaste.",Barney
6949,You are a sociopath. That was my yoga mat.,Ted
6950,"So now with Ted out of the picture, I'm gonna swoop in and take the whole thing.",Barney
6951,"Translation: 'cause I got game, bitches.",Barney
6952,"No, no, this doesn't prove anything because...",Ted
6953,"Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy.",Barney
6954,"Hey, stace. What happened? He did not. Stay there, I'll be right over.",Barney
6955,I should have just worn that stupid eye patch.,Ted
6956,I can't believe you got dumped by a 6-year-old.,Lily
6957,"Whatever. He's a stupid head. I'm just, I'm done with kids.",Robin
6958,"That's what makes you so special, baby.",Barney
6959,"Everyone, this is Blah-blah.",Ted
6960,"So, Blah, how did you two meet?",Marshall
6961,It was so magical.,Ted
6962,She's gonna tell some bogus story about a cooking class because she's embarrassed we met online.,Ted
6963,"Ay, Chihuahua.",Marshall
6964,What? There's no stigma anymore.,Ted
6965,"Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore.",Robin
6966,"So, she's hot.",Barney
6967,"Oh, she's gorgeous.",Ted
6968,Then she's crazy.,Barney
6969,No she's not.,Ted
6970,"Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes.",Barney
6971,"OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me.",Ted
6972,There's no way she's above the line on the hot-crazy scale.,Barney
6973,She's not even on the hot-crazy scale. She's just hot.,Ted
6974,"Wait, hot-crazy scale?",Robin
6975,Let me illustrate.,Barney
6976,A girl is allowed to be crazy...,Barney
6977,... as long as she is equally hot.,Barney
6978,"Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.",Barney
6979,"If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.",Barney
6980,You want the girl to be above this line,Barney
6981,"Also known as the Vicky Mendoza diagonal. This girl I dated, she played jump rope with that line. She'd shave her head...",Barney
6982,...then lose ten pounds.,Barney
6983,She'd stab me with a fork...,Barney
6984,... then get a boob job.,Barney
6985,I should give her a call.,Barney
6986,"OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class.",Ted
6987,"I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts...",Barney
6988,She's not crazy.,Ted
6989,"OK, we'll see.",Barney
6990,It's crazy how cute that is. It's crazy.,Barney
6991,You know who else has a really cute story of how they met? Marshall and Lily. You guys should tell that story right now.,Ted
6992,Aw.,Lily
6993,Starts with it too.,Marshall
6994,It was late August 1996,Lily
6995,Lily and I were both freshmen moving into,Marshall
6996,"I know, right?",Marshall
6997,"Dude, this black-haired Goth chick stopped by today, (singing) wanna tap that.",Marshall
6998,"Anybody'd be stressed out meeting new people. She's not crazy. Crazy generous maybe, buying us drinks.",Ted
6999,"No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Barney and I are not together. No. No.",Robin
7000,Really? Sixteen no's. Really?,Barney
7001,Yeah.,Robin
7002,"You know who else is friends with Ted? Marshall. How did we meet? It's a good story, I'm gonna tell it right now. Uh, it was the first day of college.",Ted
7003,I didn't realize Ted wasn't the dean until later that night.,Marshall
7004,You're not the dean.,Marshall
7005,"College, good times.",Robin
7006,"Oh, here we go.",Barney
7007,Your own line of handbags? That's crazy.,Barney
7008,"Uh, no, but I would love to buy one of them if... Where can I get one?",Robin
7009,"Look, there's nothing going on between me and Ted.",Robin
7010,"No, I'm just saying you don't have anything to worry about.",Robin
7011,"No, I'm saying that you shouldn't be.",Robin
7012,"You know what else is a good story, how Barney and I met. Barney, tell that story, right now. Please.",Ted
7013,"OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it.",Barney
7014,Tonight's the first time I'm taking my deaf brother out since our mom died.,Barney
7015,"Oh, I'm sorry about that.",Ted
7016,"No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh.",Barney
7017,"Oh man, I'm really sorry.",Ted
7018,"Wow, you bought that?",Barney
7019,"What? Barney: I just made that up mid-pee. It worked on you, it's definitely gonna work on that blonde chick at the end of the bar. Unless you're a total idiot. What's your name?",Ted
7020,Ted.,Ted
7021,"Are you a total idiot, Ted?",Barney
7022,"Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Barney: (laughs) Well played.",Ted
7023,I like you Ted.,Barney
7024,"Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.",Barney
7025,Barney. We met at the urinal.,Barney
7026,"Oh right, hi.",Ted
7027,"Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit.",Barney
7028,I'm not wearing a suit.,Ted
7029,"Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A.",Barney
7030,"Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes.",Barney
7031,"Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward.",Barney
7032,"(yelling at Ted) Edward, this is Audrey.",Barney
7033,He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like.,Barney
7034,(signing) I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.,Ted
7035,What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.,Barney
7036,(signing) My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number.,Ted
7037,"And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever.",Barney
7038,"Barney, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.",Ted
7039,(signing) He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.,Ted
7040,"Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online.",Barney
7041,"OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies.",Ted
7042,"Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right?",Barney
7043,"A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about sex, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?",Robin
7044,"Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that.",Ted
7045,"Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale.",Barney
7046,She started the night here,Barney
7047,"But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone.",Barney
7048,Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to k*ll me with a brick.,Barney
7049,"I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Robin.",Ted
7050,Their story is not as magical as it seems.,Ted
7051,"No, I can't, it's kind of a secret.",Ted
7052,"The night before Lily met Marshall, there was this party.",Ted
7053,"As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me.",Ted
7054,"Yeah, and in all these years Lily and I have never spoken about it, so again, mum's the word, OK?",Ted
7055,"If he heard that, it would destroy him.",Ted
7056,"Oh, come on, you wouldn't.",Ted
7057,Oh no.,Ted
7058,I don't think anyone wants to hear that story.,Ted
7059,"Don't be embarrassed, Ted, it was a long time ago.",Lily
7060,"Yes, that is the unabridged story of how Lily and I met. How embarrassing. Who wants another round?",Ted
7061,Tell us what?,Marshall
7062,"Lily, will you help us get the next round?",Ted
7063,"Ted, what's going on?",Lily
7064,"She knows about us, about how we really met.",Ted
7065,"Yeah, I know, I just told her.",Lily
7066,"No, the real story.",Ted
7067,"Ted, what are you talking about?",Lily
7068,"Lily, come on.",Ted
7069,Come on what?,Lily
7070,"Lily, come on.",Ted
7071,"Ted, I honestly don't know what you're talking about.",Lily
7072,"Lily, come on.",Ted
7073,What? Ted and I never made out.,Lily
7074,"Yeah, we did.",Ted
7075,"I only made out with one other guy in college before I met Marshall, and it was just some random dude. I don't even remember his name. I just call him too-much-tongue guy.",Lily
7076,What? Too-much-tongue guy? I'm not surprised to hear that coming from unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.,Ted
7077,That wasn't me.,Lily
7078,"Yes it was, at the freshman orientation party.",Ted
7079,"No, no no no no no no no no no no no.",Lily
7080,"How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin: Yeah, like five or six times.",Barney
7081,It was right over there.,Barney
7082,"Here's your problem, you've only slept with one woman. Those kind of stats are only okay if you're eleven. But tonight, we're getting you a new girl because Marshall Eriksen, from this moment on, I make all your decisions for you.",Barney
7083,"I'm sorry, who are you again?",Marshall
7084,"This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass.",Ted
7085,"I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed.",Barney
7086,"You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.",Ted
7087,"No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference.",Barney
7088,"So we should make lots of Star Wars references around girls, that's what you're saying?",Ted
7089,I'm not gonna cheat on my girlfriend.,Marshall
7090,"Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her.",Barney
7091,"How much hotter is she than your girlfriend? Marshall: There's no comparison. What do you think, Ted? Go for it? Ted: Oh, don't do it, man. Think about Lily.",Barney
7092,"You know what, I don't care. I've been with one woman for too long. I need me some strange.",Marshall
7093,"Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger.",Barney
7094,Poor guy's gonna crash and burn.,Barney
7095,That man is a god.,Barney
7096,"For like a week after, Barney followed me around, asking me to teach him how to live. I even got him to do my laundry once.",Marshall
7097,I thought it was a Mr. Miyagi kind of thing.,Barney
7098,"Marshall, I need to talk to you. Can we go somewhere in private?",Lily
7099,"Yeah, of course, what's wrong?",Marshall
7100,Too-much-tongue guy? Yeah.,Marshall
7101,And you know that girl I made out with at the freshman orientation party?,Ted
7102,Unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl? Yeah.,Marshall
7103,I'm too-much-tongue guy.,Ted
7104,And I'm unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.,Lily
7105,Worst superheroes ever.,Barney
7106,"Baby, I am so sorry.",Lily
7107,"I don't think you need to be. I was at that party. It was dark, and granted, I had eaten quite a few sandwiches but I'm a hundred percent sure that unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl was Alexa Leskies, it's not Lily.",Marshall
7108,"Really? Marshall: Yeah, I'm positive. And too-much-tongue guy was Colin O'Riley.",Ted
7109,"Are you sure? Marshall: If it wasn't, I peed in the wrong guy's shampoo, man.",Lily
7110,I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa.,Ted
7111,World of Warcraft? The online role playing game? That's how you two met online?,Barney
7112,"Yeah, it's really, it's a cool game.",Ted
7113,I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa.,Ted
7114,You and me? No idea.,Ted
7115,That was you?,Ted
7116,I know.,Lily
7117,So I am not too-much-tongue guy.,Ted
7118,No.,Ted
7119,Look what I've confiscated from some kids.,Marshall
7120,That is a fat sandwich.,Ted
7121,"I know, right?",Marshall
7122,"Chew chew chew chew, swallow.",Marshall
7123,"It's all right, honey.",Marshall
7124,Sandwiches are strong these days.,Lily
7125,I can't believe I used to be able to eat a whole sandwich by myself. Now it's like two bites and I am done.,Ted
7126,"Baby, can we grow sandwiches behind the garage?",Marshall
7127,"Dude, we're 42.",Lily
7128,Where's my wife?,Ted
7129,This is incredible!,Barney
7130,(At the same time) Oh my God! I can't believe it!,Marshall
7131,I have big news!,Barney
7132,(At the same time) Oh my God!,Marshall
7133,"Okay. My thing's pretty huge. But fine, you can go first.",Barney
7134,"Okay, I just found out...",Marshall
7135,I just find a porno starring Ted Mosby!,Barney
7136,What are you... What you're talking about?,Ted
7137,"I'm talking about welcome to the sex plane, and look who plays the navigator, Ted Mosby (He shows a porno dvd)",Barney
7138,"Oh, it's the same exact spelling as my name.",Ted
7139,"Okay, you know, cute coincidence, Barney. Whatever. I just got on the phone with the NR...",Marshall
7140,Oh my God. This totally explains the thing at my doctor's the other day.,Ted
7141,All right. Let's meet your new doppelganger. Or should I say doppel banger.,Barney
7142,"Guys, guys, guys! Can I tell my news? It's pretty...",Marshall
7143,This is really bizarre. The only other famous Mosby I know was a confederate general during the civil w*r.,Ted
7144,Probably not the same guy.,Barney
7145,"You got the job! Oh, yeah!",Ted
7146,"Congrats, buddy.",Ted
7147,Thanks. It's kind of weird hugging with p*rn on.,Marshall
7148,"Yeah, it really is.",Ted
7149,"Oh, hey, hey-o. New guy entering the cockpit. Could it be the navigator, Ted Mosby.",Barney
7150,"Uh, no. No, navigators have three stripes on their hats. Captains have four. That guy's a captain.",Ted
7151,"Yeah, and I'm sure complete accuracy in all those details was very important to the directors... &quot;Dirt and skank, the raunch brothers&quot;.",Barney
7152,"Baby, I have some exciting news.",Marshall
7153,I hope it's not that you just won some sort of race here.,Lily
7154,I got the job at the NRDC.,Marshall
7155,Wow.,Lily
7156,And I found a porno starring Ted Mosby.,Barney
7157,"I know, right?",Barney
7158,"Oh, congratulations, Marshall!",Robin
7159,Congratulation for us all.,Barney
7160,"Oh, let's go celebrate.",Lily
7161,The fact that I found a porno starring a guy named Ted Mosby... Let's do it!,Barney
7162,"Oh, is that him? Cause that Ted Mosby really knows what he's doing.",Robin
7163,"No, that's not him. What do you mean, &quot;that&quot; Ted Mosby really knows what he's doing?",Ted
7164,"Oh, no! No, I meant, that Ted Mosby, he really knows what he's doing. Like all Ted Mosbys. (to Marshall) Wow, NRDC! Way to go, Marshall.",Robin
7165,"But you're still gonna go to your job interview today, right, baby?",Lily
7166,I'm not doing that interview. Those people are evil.,Marshall
7167,"Marshall, your dad went through a lot of trouble to set this up. You can't just pull out at the last second.",Lily
7168,Apparently you can.,Robin
7169,"Ted, Ted, Ted, guy in the hat! Three stripes, ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ted Mosby, p*rn star.",Barney
7170,I know what kind of plane this is. It's a &quot;boing&quot;.,Robin
7171,"See, this is way better than Marshall's intership.",Barney
7172,It's a real job.,Marshall
7173,"Who is this guy? Are we related? Do, do I look like him?",Ted
7174,"Hmm. It's hard to tell. Go, go like this.",Marshall
7175,More around the eyes.,Barney
7176,"Oh, I do see that.",Robin
7177,"Ah, ah, very funny, Wendy. Now we know you watch p*rn. (She leaves) This Ted Mosby must be getting kind of famous.",Ted
7178,"Hmm. You're not wrong. (He looks on his phone) According to the web site, of the far superior Ted Mosby... he's been in the business three months, and he's made 125 movies.",Barney
7179,"Wow. That's 42 movies a month. Who is he, Jude Law? Right? He makes a lot of movies. I mean, not so much lately, but maybe, like, two years ago, you couldn't go to a movie without...",Robin
7180,Shh.,Ted
7181,"Adult Video Weekly? Oh, no...",Ted
7182,Hello?,Ted
7183,Oh my God! (To Marshall and Lily) AVW? It's architecture vision weekly.,Ted
7184,"Well, I don't want to say it's my project. I mean, I'll be working with at least three partners.",Ted
7185,"Yeah. Yeah. I'm really looking forward to it. I mean, I know they're gonna ride me pretty hard but they're great guys.",Ted
7186,That interview went on for 20 more minutes.,Ted
7187,"&quot;This project was so demanding, I can't tell you how many nights I spent bent over a table.&quot;",Lily
7188,"Oh, hey, baby, how'd the interview go?",Lily
7189,"Um, interesting. There I am in the office of Jefferson Coatsworth and I figure I'm not gonna take this job anyway, I might as well give this old bastard a piece of mind. Jefferson Coastworth wasn't what I expected.",Marshall
7190,Hello.,Marshall
7191,"Right, um, okay, Jeff, I've actually given this a lot of thought...",Marshall
7192,"Oh, he is good. Classic seduction technique.",Barney
7193,What do you mean?,Marshall
7194,"Oh, I use it all the time. First I buy her... and by her I mean you... a drink. Now, I'm the guy who gets her what she wants. Then I pretend to care about whatever idiotic thing she cares about. For you, that would be the enviroment. Now, I'm the great guy who shares her interests. And before you know it, you're naked in my apartment, shouting &quot;oh-oh Bar-r-r-ne-e-y&quot;! And by you, I mean her.",Barney
7195,He is not trying to seduce me. He didn't even offer me the job.,Marshall
7196,"That comes later. At dinner. He did invite you to dinner, didn't he?",Barney
7197,"I, you know, I don't know if...",Marshall
7198,The most expensive beef in the world.,Marshall
7199,Oh my God. He's trying to seduce me.,Marshall
7200,So are you gonna go to dinner with him?,Robin
7201,No. No way. I promise myself to the NRDC. I'm not that kind of lawyer.,Marshall
7202,"Oh, you should go. I mean, you're not gonna take the job, but you might as well get a great meal out of the deal.",Lily
7203,Don't wait up.,Barney
7204,"Guys, guys, guys, check this out. Ted Mosby p*rn star's bio says his hometown is your hometown. Shaker Heights, Ohio.",Robin
7205,"What? Okay, this is getting creepy. Who, who is this guy? I gotta find him.",Ted
7206,"Well, it's your lucky day. He's gonna be signing autographs tomorrow night in Manhattan at something called the Adult Video Expo.",Robin
7207,"Hmm. Wait, are you telling me that they actually have conventions for p*rn?",Lily
7208,Affirmative. Or to put in another way... God bless America.,Barney
7209,You can really taste the beef in that lobster.,Marshall
7210,"Okay. Here we go. This is the big number that's supposed to impress me and... (He looks at the paper) whoa, that's a BIG number.",Marshall
7211,"Hey, I'm going to, uh, try to remain cool. But you know Patrick Swayze?!",Marshall
7212,"Okay, no. Jeff, this is all very impressive, but I just don't think that...",Marshall
7213,Family money?,Marshall
7214,"No, hum, not that I know of. I do have an uncle who owns a, a pretty successful bait shop.",Marshall
7215,"Actually, I want to have four kids.",Marshall
7216,"Lily, you're a kindergarten teacher?",Robin
7217,Yeah.,Lily
7218,"And you make a kindergarten teacher's salary, right?",Robin
7219,Yeah.,Lily
7220,"Well, how do you afford all of these expensive clothes?",Robin
7221,I shop the sales. There were in the closet when we moved in. I steal. I'm a criminal. I once sh*t a man just to watch him die.,Lily
7222,Lily?,Robin
7223,"Oh, okay.",Lily
7224,"Well, I love commitment. I wish i could marry commitment.",Barney
7225,I met a girl last night.,Barney
7226,Really?,Ted
7227,So perky and full of life and not at all fake.,Barney
7228,"You're talking about her boobs, right?",Ted
7229,"C! And that wasn't spanish, that was cup size! What up!",Barney
7230,So these boobs...,Ted
7231,Mmmm...,Barney
7232,Paint me a word picture.,Ted
7233,"All right, Ted. Imagine the heads of two Irish babies. Let's call them...(bbllluuuuu) and (bllluuu)",Barney
7234,Please stop!,Lily
7235,Why could you come in? you hear me shaving!,Ted
7236,I thought you were shaving your face!,Lily
7237,"Well, clearly i wasn't!",Ted
7238,"Guys, it's 3:00 in the morning and it reeks in here.",Marshall
7239,Ted said it was okay.,Robin
7240,"Ted! How many times have i asked you to put the lid back on the peanut butter jar? (Ted wants to speak but Marshall goes on) It's this sort of incoiderate, immature jackassery that makes me feel like i'm living in the Realworld house, and not the early years when they all had jobs and social consciences. I'm talking about Hawaii and after! I can't take this anymore!",Marshall
7241,"Hey, here's one. Private building, recently renovated, hardwood floors, tons of light, two bedroom, 2 bath.",Marshall
7242,"Oh yeah, but that one's not for rent. It's for sale!",Lily
7243,Oh right!,Marshall
7244,You should buy a place!,Marshall
7245,what?,Lily
7246,"Baby, real estate is always a good investment!",Marshall
7247,And the market is really hot right now.,Marshall
7248,"And because of my new job, we are in such a strong place financially.",Marshall
7249,Hy! My name is Lily and I'm a shopaholic.,Lily
7250,"I buy designer clothes and accessories that i can't afford. I have 15 creditcards and they're all maxed out. And no one outside of this room, not even my husband, knows. And i feel terrible because all i want to do right now is ask you (to a girl of the meeting) where you got those shoes? They're adorable.",Lily
7251,"we can't buy, we have debt.",Lily
7252,"Yeah, i know, my sudent loans are pretty big.",Marshall
7253,I forgive you.,Lily
7254,What?,Marshall
7255,"Well... I'm just saying as your wife, you know i'm cool that you spent tens of thousands of dollars on a brand name law school because i know it make you feel good and pretty.",Lily
7256,Let's just go take a look at this place.,Marshall
7257,Where is it?,Lily
7258,"Uh, it's in a neighborhood called... Dowisetrepla?",Marshall
7259,Dowisetrepla?,Lily
7260,"O, Actually we live on the Upper West side, so...",Marshall
7261,"O right Dowisetrepla! No, i'm from New york. I know this neighborhood. I'm down in the D-town.",Lily
7262,"I'm, I'm gonna stop you right there. Dont bother with the hard sell. This place is, is way out of our price range, and besides, we've only just started to looking.",Marshall
7263,Thank you guys for coming down here so quickly.,Marshall
7264,I've never been to this neighborhood. Kind of thought this part of town was water,Ted
7265,"No, Dude. This is dowisetrepla.",Marshall
7266,Dowisetrepla?,Ted
7267,yeah!,Marshall
7268,Is that an abbreviation for something?,Ted
7269,pffff (to the estate agent) he's from Ohio. (to Ted) Dowisetrepla is the up-and-coming neighborhood.,Marshall
7270,oh!,Ted
7271,"I think this right the place where lily and i start a family, I can see it now.",Marshall
7272,"All right, bring it home, boys!",Marshall
7273,Sounds great boys! Who wants chocolate pancakes?,Lily
7274,"Man, life is gonna be sweet!",Marshall
7275,"Oh my god lily, have you seen this kitchen?",Robin
7276,I know. It's... Isn't it amazing?,Lily
7277,What the hell are you doing? You can't buy this place; lily you have a debt of the size of Mount Waddington!,Robin
7278,Waddington?,Lily
7279,It's the tallest mountain in Canada. It's like 4000 meters high.,Robin
7280,meters?,Lily
7281,"Ro, don't let Marshall fall in love with this apartment.",Robin
7282,"I know, i know, i know, i know! But what do i tell him?",Lily
7283,"I-I don't know, tell him, tell him you saw a ghost. Tell him it's haunted.",Robin
7284,You really don't know Marshall at all.,Lily
7285,"I see. Between you and me, i'm also interested in this apartment. So is there any way i could come back later and check it out while you'rte showing them other places?",Barney
7286,Are you serious? You're trying to sneak this apartment away from Marshall and Lily?,Ted
7287,"Ted, do you think i have no morals whatsoever? I simply want to fool a girl into thinking this is my apartment so i can nail her once and never have to see her again. I'm not a monster!",Barney
7288,"I see what you're doing here. &quot;another couple&quot;, please, that crap is page one out of the Realtor's playbook. And we're not buying it.",Marshall
7289,Another couple? No! We want it. Sell it to us. We'll give you so much more money.,Marshall
7290,"Oh Marshall, can i talk to you? Marshall, i just... I don't know if now is the right time to buy.&quot;",Lily
7291,"But we're not doing this for now, we're doing this for our future. Can't you imagine starting a family here?",Marshall
7292,oh persephone! oh daphne! these'll be perfect additions to our upcoming mother-daughter exhibit at the Met.,Lily
7293,Looks great girls. Who wants crapes of,Marshall
7294,"I love it, but Marshall, i should have told you this long time ago. We can't afford to buy an apartment because i have too much credit card debt. I am so sorry.",Lily
7295,"Yes! I've been staring at that thing for years. Wendy, bring me the comically large bottle of champagne.",Marshall
7296,"Honey, once you've made the sale, stop selling.",Marshall
7297,you should be a reality show.,Robin
7298,Welcome to my humble abode.,Barney
7299,"Ah, make yourself at home. Please get comfortable. If you see something you like, just take it.",Barney
7300,Uh... That's my parents.,Barney
7301,"Yeah! They're a chinese couple that wanted a white baby, it works both ways. Cookie?",Barney
7302,You got me. My sisters taught me how to bake and how to listen.,Barney
7303,"I'm glad. Sometimes, i don't. A place like this really needs a lady of the house. I know it's early to be thinking of you as... Oh, God, i'm freaking you out, aren't I? It's just you make me feel so safe. I didn't...&quot;",Barney
7304,"Hey, uh, can we get this in singles? Before we get the apartment i want to put in a kiddie pool and swim around in it naked. (laugh)",Marshall
7305,Thank you.,Marshall
7306,"What? Why? I mean, you already have Marshall's.",Lily
7307,"Well, can we just go ahead and do it in my husband's name? He's the head of the household. He earns the big bucks. I mean, can women even own property?",Lily
7308,"Go ahead, just give him your social.",Marshall
7309,"Okay my... my social is, uh... 1glmmdhgj2.",Lily
7310,"Under six percent, under six percent, please",Marshall
7311,No way. That-that can't be right.,Marshall
7312,"Let's get out of here, Marshall.",Lily
7313,"Hold it, I- i don't understand. Did we do something wrong or...?",Marshall
7314,"My student loans. Great. I thought we were friends. you know what, it's fine to penalize me for trying to get an education and bud a career, but i will not let you deprive my beautiful wife of her dream home just because i...",Marshall
7315,"Okay, let me get this straight. You just snuck this girl into some stranger's apartment?",Robin
7316,"Yeah, we spent the night.",Barney
7317,"Hey, look at you.",Barney
7318,The only thing missing from that bathrobe are your initials.,Barney
7319,Only if she sleeps in the bed and i sleep on the couch.,Barney
7320,"I love you. There, i said it and i'm not taking it back.",Barney
7321,"How about you get in the shower, and i will make us some waffles.",Barney
7322,Works at every time.,Barney
7323,Wait. That time that you offered to walk my dogs when i went to visit my dad in Vancouver...,Robin
7324,Yup!,Barney
7325,Yeah. That little guy saw some stuff i'm not proud of.,Barney
7326,Wh-what?,Robin
7327,There was a fight here.,Ted
7328,What do you mean?,Robin
7329,"Whenever Marshall and Lily have a big argument, they always leave a trail of evidence all over the apartment.",Ted
7330,"Oh, God here we go. He had a detective club as a kid.",Robin
7331,HUm the Mosby boys cracked a lot of big cases.,Ted
7332,The Mosby boys? You mean you and your sister.,Robin
7333,We solved the mystery of the missing retainer.,Ted
7334,"Let me guess, it was in the garbage.",Robin
7335,"Why are you like this? Anyway, this is serious. I know Lily and Marshall. All the tell tale signs are here. Like this",Ted
7336,A water bott.,Robin
7337,It's not stiny water bottle. Notice the label is peed off.,Ted
7338,"Just as i suspected, Cherry Garcia. Given the liquid consistency, i place the fight between... noon and 1.",Ted
7339,"Ew, that was on the floor.",Robin
7340,"If you wwant to get to the bottom of this, you're gonna need a stronger stomach than that, doll face.",Barney
7341,"Marshall stood here. Eating and yelling, yelling and eating. Lily stood here. Crying. (Ted takes a handkerchief on the bar of the kitchen)",Ted
7342,"Hey, Ted!",Robin
7343,And then Marshall tried to storm out... but Lily went for the Hail Marpass.,Ted
7344,"What do you think, make obsess?",Barney
7345,"There'd be a bigger mess. tempted as he was, Marshall was still too upset.",Ted
7346,Which Is why this picture is crooked.,Robin
7347,"Nice catch, Robin.",Ted
7348,"I'll just, uh, take this down to the lab. (He wants to take the wonderbra. Robin grab it from him).",Barney
7349,Now that we need is a motive. The million dollar question what were they fighting about?,Ted
7350,I know what they've been fighting...,Robin
7351,bup bup bup bup bup... Theres's only one possible conclusion. Lily and Marshall are fighting about peanut butter.,Ted
7352,Ah!,Barney
7353,Lily left the lid off... (Ted put dark sunglasses) and marshall blew heads.,Ted
7354,"I know what they were fighting about, and it wasn't peanut butter.",Robin
7355,"Robin, just...",Barney
7356,"I appreciate your help, but there's a reason your name is Robin, not Batman.",Ted
7357,They were fighting because they didn't get the loan and it's all Lily's fault.,Robin
7358,"Robin, just...",Barney
7359,What?,Ted
7360,"Yeah, she has a pile of debt the size of mount... Rushmore",Robin
7361,"Nice try Robin. So, the next thing Lily did was give Marshall a few hours to cool off about the peanut butter. Then she called him to apologize, which is why the last number dialed is... (Ted take the phone and see the last number)",Ted
7362,This can't be happening.,Ted
7363,They can't... get divorced.,Barney
7364,"Not Lily and Marshall, no way.",Ted
7365,"Well, it's been nice knowing you guys.",Robin
7366,What do you mean?,Ted
7367,"Well, Marshall's gonna get yyou guys, Lily's gonna get me.",Robin
7368,"Even if they break up, that doesn't mean we can't all hangout. I mean we broke up and we still hang out. It's not weird.",Ted
7369,It's a little weird.,Robin
7370,"Yeah, it is. It's weird.",Ted
7371,"The world needs Marshall and Lily... together... I'm not crying, there's something in my eye.",Barney
7372,They're back.,Robin
7373,"Hey, hey guys.",Marshall
7374,We have an annoucement.,Lily
7375,I hit redial on the phone. Divorce lawyers?,Ted
7376,"Ow, I should explain. We got in a pretty big fight.",Lily
7377,Marshall stormed out.,Lily
7378,"I went, uh, to the bar.",Marshall
7379,Still drinking that?,Lily
7380,"I paid for it. And apparently money's tight now, so...",Marshall
7381,"Listen, i've been thinking about this, and i know there's no way to undo what i've done, but, well, I made an appointment with a divorce lawyer.",Lily
7382,What?! What?!,Marshall
7383,"Oh no no! no, no, no",Lily
7384,"No! I just mean on papers, so that you can buy the apartment without my bad credit dragging us down.",Lily
7385,Lily... are you trying to k*ll me?,Marshall
7386,"I'm sorry, i shouldn't have led with the divorce lawyer part.",Lily
7387,"No, you shouldn't have! I love you, Lily.",Marshall
7388,"I love you too, and i want us to have our dream home. And well, i don't know, it seems like this is a way to do it. So Marshall Eriksen, will you divorce me?",Lily
7389,That's the sweetest divorce proposal i've ever heard.,Marshall
7390,So is that a yes? You can't sleep with other women though.,Lily
7391,"No we're not getting divorced, not even on paper. Lily, when i married you, i married your problems too. The ones i knew about and the ones i didn't. So that was the deal, we'll figure this out together. (They kiss, the waitress comes)",Marshall
7392,So you're not getting a divorce?,Robin
7393,No!,Lily
7394,"Wow, guys! You scared us.",Ted
7395,"Oh, thank God. Cause, i mean, if you did then who'd be the lame married couple i get to make fun of? Like 'Hey Marshall, you're married mrs right, you just didn't know her first name was Always.' That stuff is cold.",Barney
7396,So what's the annoucement?,Robin
7397,"I just got off the phone with the Realtor. We told her that, uh, because of our finances, we're not getting the place. It's just --it's not the right time.",Marshall
7398,We're home on earth!,Lily
7399,Ow this is exciting!,Marshall
7400,Yeah! There it is! Our new home!,Lily
7401,Shall we?,Marshall
7402,We shall.,Lily
7403,Oh! what a horrible smell.,Lily
7404,It reeks!,Marshall
7405,Wh-what plant? What are you talking about?,Lily
7406,Wait... What did you just say?,Marshall
7407,No way! March does not have 31 days.,Barney
7408,"Yes, it does! Everyone knows that. It's like general knowledge.",Marshall
7409,"Isn't it sad? I mean in 2007, some countries actually still condone corporal punishment.",Lily
7410,"Oh, man, I got a kernel stuck in my teeth.",Marshall
7411,"But after the first year,I get a major pay raise.",Marshall
7412,"So then this hot intern leans over my desk, I can totally see she has a pierced... <em>(Robin and Lily walk across the room)</em> Brosnan. Pierce brosnan is my favorite of all the bonds.",Ted
7413,I gotta go.,Barney
7414,I'm gonna go pay.,Marshall
7415,Peeing.,Lily
7416,I'm gonna help marshall pay.,Ted
7417,I'm gonna help lily pee.,Robin
7418,"All right,we have a turkey.",Lily
7419,"Yeah, we do.",Marshall
7420,Isn't this exciting? Our first Thanksgiving together as a group.,Lily
7421,"Yeah, this is gonna be the best Slapsgiving ever.",Marshall
7422,What?,Barney
7423,I said this is going to be the best Thanksgiving ever.,Marshall
7424,"yeah, this is going to be great. Just the five of us, right?",Ted
7425,"Oh, uh, that reminds me, I invited Bob.",Robin
7426,"Bob? You've been on, like, three dates with that guy. We haven't even met him.",Lily
7427,"Well, he didn't have anywhere else to go, and I didn't know what to say. Is it really that big a deal?",Robin
7428,"Yes. This is our first Thanksgiving. 30 years from now, we're going to look at the photos and say, &quot;Oh, there's the four people I love most in the world... and Bob.&quot;",Lily
7429,"I'm sorry,sometimes I forget how seriously you guys take American Thanksgiving. Real thanksgiving happened over a month ago.",Robin
7430,"I'm sorry. Did you just say Canadian Thanksgiving was and I'm quoting,&quot;the real Thanksgiving&quot;? What do Canadians even have to celebrate about?",Barney
7431,Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find the northwest passage.,Robin
7432,Why are you guys even a country?,Barney
7433,"Oh, hey, by the way, if anyone wants to come over early thursday, we can watch the Slapsgiving day parade.",Marshall
7434,"Well, there, you said it again.",Barney
7435,Said what?,Marshall
7436,Slapsgiving.,Barney
7437,"Oh, I guess I did. You know why? I've invented a new holiday: Slapsgiving. It's the one day we set aside each year to gather together and give slaps.",Marshall
7438,no.,Barney
7439,"No, no. The countdown ends at 3:00 p.m., the day after Thanksgiving. I counted it out.",Barney
7440,How many days are in october?,Ted
7441,"Uh, thirty.",Barney
7442,"Dude, I thought we cleared this up last year.",Ted
7443,Is also tomorrow.,Ted
7444,Damn it!,Barney
7445,"Wait, you're gonna slap me on Thanksgiving?",Barney
7446,Slapsgiving.,Marshall
7447,"That's not allowed. Lily, you're the slap bet commissioner, is that allowed?",Barney
7448,"The hostess in me who's using her wedding china for the first time wants to say hell, no, but yeah, I 'm going to allow it.",Lily
7449,"Well, you know what? If you're trying to freak me out about spending Thanksgiving...",Barney
7450,Slapsgiving.,Marshall
7451,"...at your place, then you failed. Truth is, I'm not scared.",Barney
7452,"Right. Cause you blew it. The worst part about getting slapped is not knowing when it's going to happen. But now I know exactly when I'm gonna get slapped. So, you took all the suspense out. You showed your hand.",Barney
7453,"And thursday at 3:01 p.m., your face is going to show my hand.",Marshall
7454,"Oh, there's Bob! By the way, heads up, he's a little bit older than us.",Robin
7455,How old is he?,Ted
7456,"He's forty-one. Hey, bob! Over here!",Robin
7457,Hi.,Robin
7458,"Hey, man, how are you?",Ted
7459,Parents?,Ted
7460,Let's go get a drink.,Robin
7461,Unbelievable. Robin is dating Orville Redenbacher.,Ted
7462,What are you talking about? He's forty-one.he looks great.,Lily
7463,"Yeah, du he's in pretty good shape. He could probably kick your ass.",Marshall
7464,"How are you guys not seeing this? He's 150; Robin's 27. Barney, come on,what do you got?",Ted
7465,Nothing but respect for that man.,Barney
7466,"Oh, by the way, we're all baking pies at robin's tomorrow. Marshall can't be trusted in the apartment with pies overnight.",Lily
7467,"For the millionth time, sleep-eating is a very serious and delicious medical condition.",Marshall
7468,"Hey, uh, what time are you guys going to robin's?",Ted
7469,7:30.,Lily
7470,"Perfect. Just to be safe, I'll get there like 8:00, 8:30.",Ted
7471,Sorry I'm late. Where are Marshall and Lily?,Ted
7472,"Uh, they just called. They're both super swamped preparing for tomorrow.",Robin
7473,Is Bob coming?,Ted
7474,"No, he went to see green day.",Robin
7475,So it's...,Ted
7476,Making pies.,Robin
7477,Pies. They're things that friends make together.,Ted
7478,"Yeah, they do.",Robin
7479,Great.,Ted
7480,Yeah.,Robin
7481,"Great. Well, this is great. It'll give us a chance to catch up.",Ted
7482,Yeah.,Robin
7483,"I'm going to make a phone call. <em>(On the phone with Barney who is at the Bar)</em> Hey, it's me. listen, you have to come over here and make pies.",Ted
7484,"Yeah, I'll be there, absolutely.",Barney
7485,"Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver. It's still kind of weird being alone with Robin, but if you were here...",Ted
7486,"Hey, say no more. I mean, when I pulled you out of that burning wreckage, I wasn't doing it to have a battleship named after me. But if you insist, yes, I'll be there for the christening.",Barney
7487,"You're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?",Ted
7488,"No, I'm not going to wear the medal of honor. That would just be tacky.",Barney
7489,So you're not coming to make pies.,Ted
7490,"No, no. Thank you, mr. President. <em>(He hungs up)</em> Sorry.",Barney
7491,"Oh, marshall, are you working on the cranberry sauce?",Lily
7492,"In a minute, baby. I've only got so many hands. You see what I got going on here? They're turkeys, but they're also hands, because later, we're going to eat turkey... and then i'm going to slap you in your face.",Marshall
7493,"Please, you took out all the suspense. In a horror movie, the k*ll does not grab a bullhorn and announce, &quot;Attention unsupervised teens here at the lake house: at precisely 3:00 a.m., I'm gonna jump out of that closet right there and hack you all up with a machete. P.S. fire is my one weakness.&quot;",Barney
7494,"Hey, ted.",Robin
7495,"Hey, happy Thanksgiving.",Ted
7496,"You, too. Is lily in the kitchen?",Robin
7497,yep.,Ted
7498,Great.,Robin
7499,Marshall?,Ted
7500,Lily?,Robin
7501,What do you mean something weird happened last night?,Marshall
7502,"You may not realize this, but since we broke up, Robin and I have never really been alone together.",Ted
7503,"So we're in the kitchen, starting on the pies, and we realize, we don't have a damn thing to say to each other.",Ted
7504,"I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now. You just feel like everything you say is gonna make things worse.",Ted
7505,"Exactly. And you know why? Because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about, especially around the holidays. I mean, what decent human being would want to cause any kind of emotional or physical pain...",Barney
7506,You're still getting slapped.,Marshall
7507,"I wanted to leave, but i couldn't stick her with making all the pies by herself. She was exhausted.",Ted
7508,I yawned like a million times trying to get him to leave.,Robin
7509,"Yeah, some people just can't take a hint. By the way, I'm really swamped in here.",Lily
7510,I kept looking at the clock and sighing... totally clueless.,Robin
7511,"Uh-huh. I'm not sure I have time to mash those potatoes, you're standing right next to.",Lily
7512,And then Ted does the thing that he always does when there's an awkward silence.,Robin
7513,"Yep. masher's right there, next to the pot.",Lily
7514,He panics and says the first thing that pops into his head.,Robin
7515,"Hey, did you know that the first pies in recorded history came from Ancient Egypt?",Robin
7516,"Remember last year's Thanksgiving, when we had sex seven times?",Ted
7517,Ooh. terrible.,Barney
7518,What?! I thought it would break the ice.,Ted
7519,I'd already broken the ice with my cool pie fact. then he makes it ten times more awkward.,Robin
7520,How do you respond to something like that?,Lily
7521,Did you know that the egyptian pyramids can be seen from space? Probably?,Robin
7522,"Ooh, the oven's pre-heated!",Ted
7523,"Okay, um... the pecan pie is gonna take the longest. Why don't we put that one in first?",Robin
7524,Pecan pie? Why are we making that?,Ted
7525,"Um, it's my favorite.",Robin
7526,You're allergic.,Ted
7527,I know. I just like smelling it. It's like eating with your nose.,Robin
7528,So we're making a pie for Bob.,Ted
7529,Yeah.,Robin
7530,She's got you making pies for this guy?,Barney
7531,Yeah.,Ted
7532,That is a real slap in the face.,Marshall
7533,"You know, you could have just told me it was for Bob.",Ted
7534,"Yeah, I-I just thought it might upset you.",Robin
7535,Upset me? Wait a second. Do you think that......Do you think that I'm jealous of Bob?,Ted
7536,I don't know. Is it so ridiculous to think that you might be?,Robin
7537,Yes.,Ted
7538,Why?,Robin
7539,Because he's a thousand years old.,Ted
7540,"No, Ted! What are you doing?",Lily
7541,Right?,Robin
7542,"The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that we can only talk about the first Thanksgiving,",Ted
7543,Come on.,Robin
7544,The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is because I heard noah gave him g*n in the ark.,Ted
7545,Ted...,Robin
7546,"The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that I'm just an architect, but he discovered fire. How do you top that?",Ted
7547,He's 41! Why are you bashing on him so hard?,Robin
7548,I'm not. I'm just joking around. That's what friends do.,Ted
7549,It's mean.,Robin
7550,"Well, how come we're all allowed to bust on barney when he dates some skanktron, but when you sleep with the crypt keeper's dad, I'm not allowed to say a word?",Ted
7551,"First of all, Bob and I are not sleeping together. We're just dating. Secondly, have I said one word about the parade of dubious conquests you've been marching past me the last few months? One of whom got you a butterfly tattoo?",Robin
7552,"Hey, that is...",Ted
7553,And if you and I are such good friends... why is baking a pie for Bob so weird?,Robin
7554,"Yeah, if you and i are such good friends, why couldn't you just tell me that's what we were doing? Okay, maybe we should talk about this later. I-I should get going.",Ted
7555,"Well, what are we doing? It's Thanksgiving.",Robin
7556,I don't know. I'm sorry. This is stupid.,Ted
7557,"I'm sorry, too. Of course we're friends. I'm glad we're friends.",Robin
7558,"me, too.",Ted
7559,That is a terrible idea!,Lily
7560,Horrible idea.,Marshall
7561,"Relapse five! That's where we high-five, then it's awkward for a little bit... and then we high-five again!",Barney
7562,What the hell were you doing? Let's review: you and Ted broke up six months ago. You're dating another man...,Lily
7563,"You are correct, Sir.",Robin
7564,...who's coming to my thanksgiving today...,Lily
7565,That is a truth-fact.,Robin
7566,...an event Ted is also attending.,Lily
7567,kablammo.,Robin
7568,Why are you trying to destroy American Thanksgiving?!,Lily
7569,"Oh, Lily, it's not as bad as it sounds. Bob and I aren't that serious, and what happened last night with Ted was a fluke.",Robin
7570,"Well, did you guys at least talk about it?",Lily
7571,: There's office material...,Ted
7572,I hear something burning...,Robin
7573,"Clearly, we need to ignore this.",Ted
7574,"Clearly, we need to talk about this.",Robin
7575,We need to talk.,Robin
7576,Stuffed mushroom?,Ted
7577,We need to talk about last night.,Robin
7578,Did you know that some mushrooms are carnivorous? Probably... not?,Ted
7579,"Ted, can we please just deal with this? Look, I'm not mad. I just think...",Robin
7580,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. why would you be mad... you started it?",Ted
7581,What?! you're crazy!,Robin
7582,"We called a truce, we hugged, and when I tried to pull away, you kept your hand on my neck.",Ted
7583,Only because your hand was still around my waist.,Robin
7584,"Oh, come on! You leaned into it.",Ted
7585,I... leaned into it?,Robin
7586,"Yeah. You're like the crappy kid in little league who knows he's not going to make contact, so he just...&quot;Oops, I got hit by the pitch. Better take my base.&quot;",Ted
7587,"Oh, that was you in little league, wasn't it?",Robin
7588,My on-base percentage was off the charts!,Ted
7589,"Oh, no! The slap-petizers.",Marshall
7590,"You know what? That's it! This is Thanksgiving. Solve this right now. And if you have sex again, neither of you gets dessert! Oh, what the hell kind of Thanksgiving is this anyway?",Lily
7591,"Um, most Thanksgivings.",Barney
7592,"Don't stress, baby. I'll try to find us something relaxing.",Marshall
7593,"Thanks, baby. Ooh, some classical music, maybe.",Lily
7594,"Oh, my! Look at that. That means we're in the final hour of the countdown.",Marshall
7595,I'm not scared.,Barney
7596,"Then why is your right cheek twitching? It's not... maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard, it reverberates back to the present, shattering the time-slap continuum.",Marshall
7597,Please don't slap me.,Barney
7598,"I'm sorry, what?",Marshall
7599,"Oh, God! don't slap me again! I don't want to get slapped again, and the first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it! I don't like it one bit!",Barney
7600,"I thought I ruined it by putting a clock on it, Barney?",Marshall
7601,"Well, you didn't ruin it; you made it so much worse! I can't eat. I can't sleep. I've lost ten pounds; my suits are wearing me. You know what? I'm outta here.",Barney
7602,"Well, no, no, no. you can't leave.",Marshall
7603,"Why can't I?! Nowhere in the rules does it say that I have to sit through sort of mental torture! You are allowed to slap my face, Sir, but you are not allowed to slap my mind! Good day!",Barney
7604,But it's Slapsgiving.,Marshall
7605,"No! It's not! It's Thanksgiving! Our first one as a married couple, as grownups and you're not even trying to be a part of it! None of you are! So... as slap bet commissioner, I'm issuing a ruling. Thanksgiving is a day of peace. There will be no slaps today!",Lily
7606,What?!,Marshall
7607,Yes! In your face! Not my face... your face!,Barney
7608,"Baby,please... -no!",Marshall
7609,"The slap bet commissioner's word is final, so get in the kitchen and mash some potatoes, now. And for the rest of the day, we are going to enjoy a civilized, grownup holiday.",Lily
7610,"Look at us! We can't be alone together, can we?",Robin
7611,Apparently not.,Ted
7612,What does that mean? We're supposed to be friends.,Robin
7613,"We aren't friends, are we? Not really. We avoid each other. We smile politely. We're two people who pretend to be friends because it would be inconvenient not to.",Ted
7614,"Well, maybe we should stop pretending.",Robin
7615,Maybe we should.,Ted
7616,So... what do we do now?,Robin
7617,I suppose... we eat dinner. And then that's it.,Ted
7618,Okay.,Robin
7619,Happy Thanksgiving.,Ted
7620,"Marshall, you're not eating. Did something spoil your slap-petite?",Barney
7621,"No, i just thought...before we eat, maybe the chef would like to say a few words.",Marshall
7622,Nope. This sucks. Eat up and leave.,Lily
7623,"Well, then, I'd like to say something. If that's cool? Um... today, Lily did something great. Not only did she gather us all here together and cook a delicious meal, but she also started a new tradition. We're gonna do this again next year, and the year after that... maybe for the rest of our lives. I think that's pretty amazing if you think about it. And it's all thanks to you,Lily. I love you. So, to the first of many Thanksgivings together.",Marshall
7624,"Oh, no...",Lily
7625,I thought we were done with that?,Barney
7626,I guess we're not.,Robin
7627,Guess we're not.,Ted
7628,"Hey, check it out! We're in the last 20 seconds of Marshall's countdown to nothing.",Barney
7629,"Barney, put it away.",Lily
7630,"How does it feel, Marshall,to sit there, impotently... your large, flaccid hand,just dangling in the wind?",Barney
7631,"Ooh, classy touch, dude. Too bad!",Barney
7632,"Barney, put it away.",Lily
7633,I will in... five...,Barney
7634,You can slap him.,Lily
7635,"What?! Wait, you...",Barney
7636,"That's three! Thanks, baby, you're the best. And as a special, added bonus, I've composed a song just for this occasion. Ted, lights! (Marshall starts playing the piano and singing) <em>*What is this feelin' that's put you in your place a hot, red burnin' on the side of your face you feel the bl*od rush to your cheek. Tears start to fill your eyes and your lips are tremblin' but you can't speak,you're tryin', oh, you're tryin' not to cry! You just got sla-apped-oh, oh! Across the face, my friend-oh, oh, oh! You just got slapped. Yes, that really just happened. Everybody saw it and everybody laughed and clapped, it was awesome. Wait,you just got... slapped. Happy Slapsgiving, everybody.*</em>",Marshall
7637,"Well, guys have fun.",Lily
7638,This is gonna be majoy cleaner.,Ted
7639,"Oh man, we're gonna be doing this all the time, now aren't we?",Marshall
7640,That's the general idea.,Robin
7641,"oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp!",Barney
7642,a tramp stamp?!,Ted
7643,"Say goodbye, kids, 'cause it won't be around much longer. (He shows his tattoo)",Ted
7644,"oh, but Ted, if you get rid of the butterfly, how's everyone gonna know you're a stripper fron reno with daddy issues?",Lily
7645,"yes, yes, enjoy these final moments of mockery because in just ten surprisingly expensive sessions, Stella is gonna zap that butterfly right off the face of my lower back.",Ted
7646,Stella?,Lily
7647,Dr Stella Zinman. She's the best in the business. And she's rather cute in fact. In fact... we're going to a movie together tonight.,Ted
7648,what?,Barney
7649,I asked her out.,Ted
7650,what's matter with you?,Barney
7651,What? What do you mean?,Ted
7652,Dude... don't poop where you eat.,Barney
7653,"oh, no, this doesn't count.",Ted
7654,"If it's someone you see on a regular basis, and you can't avoid them...",Marshall
7655,"and in this case, you're paying them... then yes, it counts.",Lily
7656,"You've heard of the golden rule, right? &quot;love their neighbor?&quot;",Barney
7657,"uh, actually, it's &quot;do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot; It's from the bible.",Ted
7658,"Damn it Ted, i've worked out this whole thing where the golden rule is &quot;love thy neighbor&quot;, ok?... Now the golden rule is &quot;love thy neigbor&quot;. But, there's one rule above it: the platinum rule: &quot;never ever, ever, ever, love thy neighbor.&quot;",Barney
7659,"Well, that's cute. But she's not my neighbor, she's my doctor. So if you'll excuse me...",Ted
7660,"Wait, Ted, Barney has a point. Remember what happened with me and curt down at the station?",Robin
7661,"Oh, yeah, and remember what happened with us and the gerards across the hall?",Marshall
7662,Need i remind you about me and Wendy the waitress?,Barney
7663,"good, then we've got a solid half hour. And in that time, we will convince you not to set foot out that door. It's a story older than time, my friend, and it always plays out in the same eight steps. Step 1: Attraction.",Barney
7664,It's true.,Barney
7665,That's not even possible.,Marshall
7666,12 of them.,Barney
7667,There's no way.,Marshall
7668,Thanks.,Barney
7669,"Oh, hi, welcome to the building. Yeah.",Marshall
7670,We love brunch!,Lily
7671,yeah!,Robin
7672,"Oh, welcome. You look really familiar. Are you a former athlete?",Robin
7673,"But you know better. You've seen your friends make the same mistakes before. You've laughed smugly at them.(laughs) Idiots! But still, you think, &quot;this is different. The platinum rule doesn't apply to me.&quot; And that step 2! Bargaining.",Barney
7674,I think i've got a little crush on our sports guy.,Robin
7675,"I know, i know but he used to play hockey, and i'm canadian. I can't help it. If he were missing some teeth, i probably would have already hit that.",Robin
7676,"Robin, it's a mistake. Remember what happened with me and Marshall? The Gerards across the hall?",Lily
7677,Michael and LAura. They're awesome. We're gonna invite them over for dinner.,Lily
7678,"This is NYC.You don't get close to the neighbors. You nod at them politely in the hall. You call the cops if you haven't seen them in a while and you smell something funny, and that is it.",Ted
7679,we're not gonna date them. We're just gonna be friends with them.,Lily
7680,That's the couples version of dating.,Barney
7681,"And you've got the couples version of the hots for them. Oh, yeah, you want to browse at pottery barn with them. You want to go antiquing with them, don't you? Oh, yeah, you want to antique the crap out of them.",Robin
7682,Need i remind you what happened with me and Wendy the waitress?,Barney
7683,I've decided to seduce Wendy the waitress.,Barney
7684,Request denied! What rule is there that say's i can't seduce the waitress at my favorite bar?,Barney
7685,I don't know. I'd expect you to have one already.,Lily
7686,"Yeah, with some sort of catchy name.",Robin
7687,"Well, i don't. I don't have one and i never will be because it's a great idea. Come on, guys! She's gullible. I'm bored. We're perfect for each other.",Barney
7688,"Barney, we love this bar. If you screxw over Wendy the waitress, you're going to k*ll the bar.",Ted
7689,Bar k*ll.,Robin
7690,"Don't k*ll the bar, dude.",Marshall
7691,"yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.",Barney
7692,"yeah, well, i think it'll be okay.",Marshall
7693,"yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.",Robin
7694,And it was a huge mistake.,Robin
7695,"yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.",Ted
7696,"Ted, trust me. You don't want to do this.",Barney
7697,"Look, Stella and i are adults; we're both smart, mature people capable of making good decisions.",Ted
7698,You have a butterfly tramp stamp.,Robin
7699,"We're just seeing a movie. If it seems at all weird, i'll back off.",Ted
7700,That's what everyone thinks and then along comes step 3: Submission.,Barney
7701,Good night!,Barney
7702,Not at all.,Barney
7703,Want to have dinner with us tonight?,Lily
7704,Club soda can get anything off.,Barney
7705,"hey, can i get a gin and tonic?",Barney
7706,"See, i bet you didn't pay for that gin and tonic.",Ted
7707,"oh, i paid for it.",Barney
7708,"But you got to admit, there is an upside to breaking the platinum rule. Like maybe as her boyfrien, i could get a discount on treatments.",Ted
7709,"Oh, Ted, of course there's an upside. At first, that's step 4: Perks.",Barney
7710,"we can split a cab to work together. We always have a standing lunch date. And last night, at the hockey game, Curt got us into the locker room, and i met Mason Raymond. Left wing for the Vancouver canucks.",Robin
7711,What the opposite of name-dropping?,Barney
7712,"Damn it you guys, be psyched. Yes, we see each other every day, but i think it's going really well.",Robin
7713,That's what we thought.,Lily
7714,And it's so conveniant. They're right across the hall. Say it's sunday and we want to have a brunch double date with someone.,Lily
7715,We just go across the hall.,Marshall
7716,And say we want to have a dinner party exploring the wine and cuisine of France's Loire Valley.,Lily
7717,We just go across the hall.,Marshall
7718,Say we want to play a game of charades...,Lily
7719,"Come on people, get excited for us! We've got a great thing going here.",Lily
7720,That's what i thought.,Barney
7721,"Dude, you got to flick it.",Marshall
7722,you don't have... (Wendy the waitress comes and serves food to Barney),Barney
7723,"Come on, guys, free nachos. What?",Barney
7724,We like this bar.,Ted
7725,"Don't k*ll the bar, dude.",Marshall
7726,"Barney, we love this bar.",Ted
7727,"Don't k*ll the bar, dude.",Marshall
7728,This bar is like home to us.,Ted
7729,You're k*ll the bar.,Lily
7730,"I'm not k*ll the bar. Wendy the waitress has seen how i operate in this place. It is perfectly clear to everyone involved that this is nothing more than a temporary fling. (Wendy starves him, lovely) It's fiiine.",Barney
7731,It's fine.,Marshall
7732,It's fine.,Robin
7733,But it wasn't.,Robin
7734,Which brings us to step 5: THE TIPPING POINT.,Barney
7735,Thanks iron man we'll be right back.,Robin
7736,So you want to do something later?,Robin
7737,What are you talking about?,Robin
7738,"oh, um, i'm sorry, i-i guess i just forgot.",Robin
7739,"on my suggestion, you... (Barney looks at a girl)",Marshall
7740,"hey, Wendy, uh, do me a favor and send a glass of champagne to that pretty young girl over there.",Barney
7741,over there... YOU... you're the pretty young thing...is what i meant. Champagne? Would you? on me.,Barney
7742,okay. All right.,Barney
7743,"um, well, we actually have tickets...",Lily
7744,"Dude, actually, we made other plans, so... okay (Michael mimes) one word. 2 syllables. Sounds like... parades: charades.",Marshall
7745,which brings to step 6.,Barney
7746,"Yeah, listen i'm leaving so if you want to write the rest of these down, i will read it tomorrow.",Ted
7747,Don't do this Ted.,Barney
7748,You want to get out of the way?,Ted
7749,Don't do this Ted. Don't (He brushes his hair in a mess),Ted
7750,Dude! ya! It was perfect! You're such a jerk!,Ted
7751,Which brings us to step 6. You finally realize you've made a huge mistake and now you have to live with it. Step 6 is called purg... wait for it. Keep waiting. Keep waiting for the eternity only to dicover there's no escap-atory.,Barney
7752,"God, i'm such an idiot.",Robin
7753,yeah.,Marshall
7754,"Curt &quot;the iron man&quot; irons keeps leaving me love notes on post-its. On the teleprompter, on my desk, on the coffee-maker, on the jar of sugar packets next to the coffee-maker.",Robin
7755,The iron man. oh!,Robin
7756,I remember that.,Marshall
7757,Ro! we are such idiots!,Marshall
7758,Yeah!,Barney
7759,"Every time we step out the door, they're out there waiting for us. Sometimes, we'll send Ted out first as a scout. Nobody's there. Then we'll go out one second later, and there they are.",Lily
7760,It's freakin' supernatural. Are they ghosts? Can only we see them?,Marshall
7761,"&quot;Hey neighbor!&quot; &quot;Hey, neighbor&quot;&quot;Hey neighbor.&quot;",Lily
7762,I remember that.,Barney
7763,How could you guys let me date Wendy the waitress?,Barney
7764,Don't k*ll the bar dude!,Marshall
7765,"tss (He looks at a girl but Wendy is right behind, she smiles, he looks desperate)",Barney
7766,"You've got a whole meat locker at home full of corpses, don't you?",Ted
7767,"Now look at me. Declawed. Neutered. What was once my jungle is now my zoo and i am forced to mate with the same old lioness again, and again, and again while families pay to watch.",Barney
7768,"yeah, this metaphor's really falling apart.",Ted
7769,"Put a bell around my neck and scratch my belly kids, for i am just a docile housecat now. Miaou!",Barney
7770,"Well, we love this bar. You can't dump her. Marry her if you have to.",Lily
7771,Wendy the waitress hyphen Stinson.,Robin
7772,don't k*ll the bar dude.,Marshall
7773,"And so, inevitably, you have to do the thing you've been dreading all along. Now, a relationship-ectomy is a delicate surgery as it is, but in the case of the platinum rule, it takes a very, very steady hand, and that's step 7: CONFRONTATION.",Barney
7774,"Curt, we need to talk. I like you...",Robin
7775,"guys, we like you a lot...",Marshall
7776,I don't like you.,Barney
7777,"We're pretending this works, but it doesn't. And i'm getting a little sick of the whole charade.",Robin
7778,We're getting a little sick of charades.,Lily
7779,"I mean, i don't like you that way. I used to like you that way but now that i've seen everything there is to see, i don't know, i kind of want to see those same parts just on other girls.",Barney
7780,So maybe we could go back to just being coworkers.,Robin
7781,Maybe we should just go back to being neighbors.,Marshall
7782,"other girls and you, if you're into that but the other girls have to be there, too. That's the important part.",Barney
7783,or that. Let's say it's that. So can i get a gin and tonic?,Barney
7784,"And in any other relationship, that would be it. End of story. But because you have to see this person again, there's a step 8: FALLOUT.",Barney
7785,"And now, here's Curt &quot;the iron man&quot; irons with sports. Curt? (he's demoralized) Curt?",Robin
7786,"Uh, well, their perimeter sh**ting has been a little bit off this season...",Robin
7787,And that's sports.,Robin
7788,Do you see anything?,Lily
7789,I think we're clear.,Marshall
7790,"ok go go go. (They go out but the door of the Gerards opens, they gets in quickly)",Lily
7791,That was close.,Marshall
7792,Too close. (Someone knocks on the door) You've got to be kidding me. What do we do?,Lily
7793,I have no idea. (it knocks again),Marshall
7794,"guys, are you here? I forgot my keys. Can you open up?",Ted
7795,It's just Ted!,Lily
7796,Wait! (He looks at the judha: Ted is alone),Marshall
7797,Hello? Guys? (Marshall looks again and see the Gerards go out their apartment),Ted
7798,"Baby, we only have one choice.",Marshall
7799,"Okay, hurry! (They come down to the rescue ladder) Michael and Laura are probably...",Lily
7800,Thanks Wendy. Of course we can.,Barney
7801,waouh. I've got to hand it to Wendy the waitress that was very mature of her.,Ted
7802,She's gonna try to k*ll me. This is poisoned.,Barney
7803,What? You're being ridiculous.,Ted
7804,Yours is poisoned too. She's trying to k*ll me and everyone close to me.,Barney
7805,What are you talking about?,Ted
7806,Ted! Look at the facts. I dump her and she says &quot;no hard feelings&quot;. She's a psycho! What other explanation is there?,Barney
7807,"Uh, that you're letting yourself believe she's crazy so you don't have to face the far more likely possibility that she doesn't want to date you either?",Ted
7808,Where did Marshall get that hamburger?,Barney
7809,"I don't know, i guess Wendy the Waitress brought it to him.",Ted
7810,Dude.,Marshall
7811,You're welcome.,Barney
7812,"Wait a second. You've been sitting here, pretending to be the expert on all this, but the truth is, this was no real fallout from your breakup at all?",Robin
7813,Yet.,Barney
7814,You're an idiot.,Robin
7815,"All right, i'm taking off.",Ted
7816,What?,Barney
7817,I have a date. (Barney brushes Ted's hair in a mess),Ted
7818,You're such a jerk!,Ted
7819,"Ted, have you not been listening? Attraction, bargaining, submission, perks, tipping point, purgatory, confrontation, fallout! These things will all happen to you as surely as they happened to all of us! It's a rule of nature.",Barney
7820,"Well, i'm sick of all the rules! There's too many of them! The hot/crazy scale, the lemon law, the platinum rule! If everyone in the world followed every one of your rules, the human race would cease to exist. Yes chances are to Stella and I are not going to live happily ever after the overwhelming odds have it ending badly. And when that happens, it'll be for one of a million possible reasons. But that doesn't mean i'm not gonna try. And when it does fail, so help me god, it's not gonna be because of some rule. (He watches himself in th mirror) PS: you just made my hair look awesome. Good night. (He leaves)",Ted
7821,So what do you mean &quot;it wasn't a date&quot;?,Marshall
7822,She thought we were seeing a movie just as friends.,Ted
7823,Why would she think that?,Marshall
7824,Did she see your tattoo and assume you were gay?,Robin
7825,"Apparently, there's a rule that says i can't date Stella.",Ted
7826,"Exactly, the platinum rule. Stella reads my blog.",Barney
7827,"No, this rule comes from the american medical association. Doctors aren't legally allowed to date their patients.",Ted
7828,"Oh, sorry Ted.",Lily
7829,It's okay. What are you guys watching?,Ted
7830,Thanks for watching.,Robin
7831,So what do you guys have going on tonight?,Lily
7832,Have fun.,Marshall
7833,Thanks. (She leaves and he throws the drink) Crazy!,Barney
7834,"No, I just thought it would be cool to get a caterpillar tattoo, and then a few weeks went by, and all of a sudden...",Ted
7835,"Well, I think you'll find I have a very high tolerance for pain. Just last night, I sat through the worst movie ever made.",Ted
7836,"No, the worst movie... Manos: Hands of Fate.",Ted
7837,"Uh-huh. I don't believe you, Doctor.",Ted
7838,"Hey. Hey, put that away. Tonight's on me.",Ted
7839,"Come on, I insist.",Ted
7840,"Oh, wow. Oh, yay. Wow, thank you. One, two, three, four.",Ted
7841,"No, it's just, um... I'm just a little embarrassed. I thought this was a date. But it's no big deal. Don't worry about it.",Ted
7842,"Yeah, I got it.",Ted
7843,"Yeah, yeah. Hey, you were right. Worst movie-going experience ever. Of course, it had nothing to do with the movie.",Ted
7844,"No, it's fine. I got to hang out with you on girls' night out. All right, so if you're not allowed to date a patient, I'll just... I'll wait until these ten session are up and then I'll ask you out then.",Ted
7845,"Really? I'm getting mixed signals from you. I feel like you've been staring at my ass for quite some time. What, you're married?",Ted
7846,Boyfriend?,Ted
7847,Lesbian?,Ted
7848,Only date black guys?,Ted
7849,"And yet you can say with absolute confidence that ten weeks from now, if I ask you out on a date, your answer will be...",Ted
7850,"No... Hmm. What could she mean when she says 'no'? I don't know, it is totally cryptic.",Robin
7851,This is far from over. We're talking ten weeks from now. Who knows what she'll want then? Do you know what you're going to want for lunch ten weeks from now?,Ted
7852,"Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail and a milk shake.",Marshall
7853,"Ted, do you know how long it takes a woman to decide whether or not she's going to sleep with a guy? 8.3 seconds. After that, her decision is made. She will not change her mind.",Barney
7854,That's ridiculous.,Ted
7855,Is it? Describe your first 8.3 seconds with Stella.,Barney
7856,"So we got off to a rocky start. That may be a problem for some guys, but I get better over time. Right? I'm not some Top 40 song... easily digestible. I'm complex. I require time and multiple listens. I'm 'Stairway to Heaven'.",Ted
7857,"Wow, Roger Daltrey just rolled over in his grave. That's not the right guy, is it? He's not even dead, is he?",Robin
7858,"I think that's great, Ted. You can do whatever you set your mind to. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm going to stop biting my nails.",Lily
7859,"But, baby, you love biting your nails.",Marshall
7860,"I know, but I'm doing this for Ted. Hmm. God, this is really hard.",Lily
7861,"Give me ten sessions, I'm going to turn that &quot;no&quot; into a &quot;yes.&quot;",Ted
7862,"Really, Ted? You think so? Well, tell me, how did the rest of that session go?",Barney
7863,"Yeah, well, I can handle pain. This one time I was playing tennis, and... <em>(He screams in a high-pitched ton)</em>",Ted
7864,Here's to nine more great sessions.,Ted
7865,"Still no. What's up with that? I mean, I juggled.",Ted
7866,You juggled? I thought you were trying to impress her.,Barney
7867,You do magic. How is juggling any lamer than magic?,Ted
7868,Magic's not lame.,Barney
7869,I don't get it. I mean...,Ted
7870,Is this lame?,Barney
7871,"Oh, Barney, no, no. We said no fireballs at the table.",Robin
7872,What the hell is wrong with you?,Marshall
7873,There's alcohol in here.,Robin
7874,Barney...,Lily
7875,I...,Barney
7876,We've talked about this. It's a fire code violation.,Lily
7877,"Yeah, but Ted provoked me.",Barney
7878,"No, no, you are on a time-out. Go sit over there.",Lily
7879,But...,Barney
7880,Go!,Lily
7881,Anyway... I don't get it. She should be into me by now.,Ted
7882,"You know, you can do this, Ted. I said that I would stop biting my nails, and kablam-ey. It's just a challenge. It can't be easy to woo someone while you're sticking your naked butt in their face.",Lily
7883,Works for baboons. It's called &quot;presenting.&quot;,Marshall
7884,I got four sessions left. Ther-There's got to be an angle I'm not seeing.,Ted
7885,"You can't turn a &quot;no&quot; into a &quot;yes,&quot; Ted. Can't be done.",Barney
7886,"I don't know, Barney. I mean, sometimes persistence pays off. I said &quot;yes&quot; eventually.",Robin
7887,"No, you didn't. You were like, &quot;No, we can't, we're friends. It would mess up the dynamic of the group.&quot;",Barney
7888,To Ted.,Robin
7889,"Oh, right.",Barney
7890,"Wait a second. Wait a second, I got the angle.",Ted
7891,The receptionist. That's my way in.,Ted
7892,I like this. Seduce the receptionist. That's a great plan.,Barney
7893,That's not the plan. And how would that help me with Stella?,Ted
7894,Who?,Barney
7895,Here's the plan.,Ted
7896,"Hi. Here. I stopped... <em>(He takes the bag back and wait for stella to be able to see him to give it back to Abby)</em> Hi, I stopped for coffee and I... and I thought I'd grab you something.",Ted
7897,What?,Ted
7898,And now... we wait.,Ted
7899,Break it.,Ted
7900,Abby is...?,Ted
7901,"Oh, Abby. I thought you said &quot;Alan.&quot;",Ted
7902,"Right. Right, I thought I said &quot;Alan.&quot;",Ted
7903,Who's Abby?,Ted
7904,Exactly.,Ted
7905,What is happening?,Ted
7906,"Ted. You just got to be yourself, no more gimmicks.",Lily
7907,"You're right, no more gimmicks. One more gimmick.",Ted
7908,You know what's on her shelf? That self-help book 'The Power of Me'.,Ted
7909,"I know, I know, but I thought if I read it, maybe we'd have something new to talk about.",Ted
7910,It's actually a great book. It taught me the power of complete memory.,Marshall
7911,Can I borrow your copy?,Ted
7912,I left it somewhere... I forget.,Marshall
7913,Hi. Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.,Ted
7914,Telepathically?,Ted
7915,"It's crazy. Yeah, I understand. I was just, uh, checking out the old bookshelf here. I see you've read 'The Power of Me'. It's funny...",Ted
7916,"Oh, thank God. <em>(chuckling)</em> I couldn't agree more. That's total crap. I see people reading that on the subway and I just want to shout, &quot;Get a life, people!&quot;",Ted
7917,What?,Ted
7918,"What? No, that's... that's not mine. I've never seen that before in my life.",Ted
7919,"Wha... no, you have me confused with someone else.",Ted
7920,"Ted, I hate to say this, but I think it's &quot;nail the receptionist&quot; time.",Robin
7921,I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.,Ted
7922,"Ted, every little boy wants to grow up to nail the doctor or the lawyer. Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist.",Barney
7923,No. I like Stella.,Ted
7924,"Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, Ted. Your little Stella is not so perfect.",Barney
7925,What do you mean?,Ted
7926,"I went down there and checked her out for myself. Yeah. And while I was down there, I discovered that she had a secret, a terrible... terrible secret.",Barney
7927,What? What is it?,Ted
7928,"Hold on, I gotta pee. <em>(He stands up et goes to the toilets)</em> Okay, I'm back. What's going on at work?",Barney
7929,What's the big secret?!,Ted
7930,"Oh. Oh, right.",Barney
7931,"Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please.",Barney
7932,"Oh, I just want to see her. Want to look at her, see what she looks like.",Barney
7933,"I'm sorry, did I accidentally oprima numero dos when I called? Do you speak English? I want to see her!",Barney
7934,What are your credentials?!,Barney
7935,I want to know who am I speaking with!,Barney
7936,"At first she seemed great, beautiful, smart, way out of your league. But then, I overheard this conversation.",Barney
7937,Folliculaphilia?,Ted
7938,Folliculaphilia.,Barney
7939,What is that?,Ted
7940,"Ted, your perfect woman can only be attracted to men with moustaches.",Barney
7941,That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. That's not real.,Ted
7942,"You're right, Ted. I'm just making that up.",Barney
7943,I know that you are because there's no such thing.,Ted
7944,I got it a little bit.,Robin
7945,"Hi. Uh, Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.",Ted
7946,Why? Just why?,Ted
7947,Y-you don't remember?,Barney
7948,I'll bet anyone ten bucks I can get Ted to grow a moustache.,Barney
7949,Uh... okay.,Ted
7950,You sabotaged my next to last chance with Stella for ten dollars?,Ted
7951,"I know. I would've done it for free. But, no. You owe me ten bucks.",Barney
7952,"This is awful. My-my tenth session is next week. I'm gonna ask her out, and she's gonna say the most demoralizing syllable in the English language... no. You know what? Just forget it. I'm not even gonna ask her.",Ted
7953,"No, you have to. She likes you. She said so herself. (<em>clearing throat)</em> I mean...",Lily
7954,"Oh, my God, you went and saw her, too.",Ted
7955,"I swear to you, I did not.",Lily
7956,My wife's always getting on me about my dry elbows. So good to be in a relationship. Anyone special in your life? Or maybe just someone you're interested in? Interes-ted in?,Marshall
7957,"Irregular? Oh, my God. This is it. It's all over.",Marshall
7958,"Can you stop talking about your other patients?! I'm dying here, woman!",Marshall
7959,"Okay. Hey, what was it you were saying before about the guy with the butterfly tattoo?",Marshall
7960,Oh. Okay. Thank you.,Marshall
7961,No.,Ted
7962,Yes.,Marshall
7963,She said &quot;crush&quot;? And she was talking about me?,Ted
7964,"Stella...now that I'm no longer your patient, would you like to have dinner with me?",Ted
7965,"Oh, no.",Ted
7966,I am gonna k*ll Marshall.,Ted
7967,"Oh, my God, this is worse than the laser.",Ted
7968,What?,Ted
7969,There it is... she's a mom. It's just not gonna happen.,Ted
7970,"Sorry, dude. Have a shrimp.",Marshall
7971,I'm good. I guess I got no one but myself to blame. She told me right from the start she was gonna say no and sure enough... Wait a minute.,Ted
7972,You didn't actually say no.,Ted
7973,"All this time you were, uh, you were supposed to say no, but you didn't... I checked the transcript. So, here's what I'm proposing. Uh... You only have two minutes, right?",Ted
7974,"Okay. You want to, uh... go on a a two-minute date with me?",Ted
7975,Great. And... go. Taxi!,Ted
7976,I know.,Ted
7977,"380 West 22nd, please. And step on it. We're in a hurry.",Ted
7978,Right this way.,Ted
7979,"So, college?",Ted
7980,Uh-huh. Wesleyan.,Ted
7981,No. Scott Crable?,Ted
7982,Thanks.,Ted
7983,Could we get the check please. We're trying to make a movie in 15 seconds.,Ted
7984,"Okay, great. Uh, how do you want to do this? You had the eggplant parm. I only really had water so... I'm kidding. Oh. Okay. Let's go. Taxi! You nervous?",Ted
7985,You can't tell at all.,Ted
7986,384 West 22nd.,Ted
7987,"Nah, previews. We'll be fine. Ah! Just in time. It hasn't started yet.",Ted
7988,Manos: Hands of Fate.,Ted
7989,Only the important parts. Worst movie ever.,Ted
7990,How we doing on time? Taxi!,Ted
7991,Okay. Do you want to walk it?,Ted
7992,So what grade's your daughter in?,Ted
7993,Ah! That's a good year.,Ted
7994,What?,Ted
7995,"Oh. Look, coffee and dessert?",Ted
7996,"I know. New York. It's a living organism, an ever-changing tapestry. Ooh, look at the time. Let's go.",Ted
7997,Flowers?,Ted
7998,"Okay. See? We're getting to know each other. Stella, I had a lovely... Doggy bag? Stella, I had a lovely time.",Ted
7999,And... date.,Ted
8000,"That wasn't so bad, right? No lengthy, awkward silences. Dessert ran a little long, so... I had to cut the good-night kiss.",Ted
8001,"Look, I would love to have a second date, I would. But I understand that you really don't have time right now, but if you ever do, will you give me a call?",Ted
8002,Okay.,Ted
8003,"No, no, no, no!",Ted
8004,Wow. This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk. You know your problem? You're too sweet.,Barney
8005,"Oh, yeah. Turns out it's just a Raisinet. Hey, how would you like me to take you out to a fancy restaurant and then go on a shopping spree? Treat you the way you should be treated. Would that make you forget about that Ted monster?",Barney
8006,We just have to go by my hotel room first. My bed was broken. I just have to make sure they fixed it.,Barney
8007,I like you.,Barney
8008,Hey.What's with the blackboard?,Robin
8009,It's our NCAA bracket.,Ted
8010,Big board equals big luck!,Marshall
8011,"Hey, that looks familiar, where did you get it?",Lily
8012,"Hello. Uh, I'm looking for my wife, Ms.Aldrin.",Marshall
8013,Of course. How could I forget?,Marshall
8014,Big board!,Ted
8015,Big luck!,Marshall
8016,"We found it. No big deal. Anyway, every year, Ted and I go in together on this big money pool out in Staten Island.",Marshall
8017,"Yeah. The winner gets $100,000 stuffed in a duffel bag.",Ted
8018,And you get to keep the duffel bag.,Marshall
8019,Why do you guys put yourselves through this? You lose every year.,Lily
8020,"That's because in the past, we were just guessing. This year, we watched every game, read box scores, tracked injuries. This isn't March Madness. This is March Meticulously Thought-outness.",Ted
8021,Your team lost 20 minutes ago.,Barney
8022,I didn't know they were playing today.,Ted
8023,"You okay, Barney?",Lily
8024,Something strange is going on. I was down at the hardware store trying to get a little somethin' somethin'.,Barney
8025,Wait. You go to the hardware store to pick up girls?,Robin
8026,There are four kinds of women who go to the hardware store by themselves.,Barney
8027,Of course there are.,Robin
8028,"Single, recently single, recently divorced, lesbian who will let me watch.",Barney
8029,You could not be more evil.,Lily
8030,"Sorry. Five. Recently widowed. So, I'm talking to this girl...",Barney
8031,"Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder.",Barney
8032,I was only gone for a second when...,Barney
8033,See? Skid-proof.,Barney
8034,The same thing happened at the pet store yesterday.,Barney
8035,Pet store?,Marshall
8036,"Single girl, mid-twenties, looking for a canine replacement for the boyfriend who just dumped her. Instead, finds Barney.",Ted
8037,"God bless you, Ted. You're reading my blog.",Barney
8038,I'm really bored at work.,Ted
8039,"I'd call your ex a dog, but that would be an insult to little Ladybug here.",Barney
8040,"Not without a chew toy from Uncle Barney first. And when I got back... I'm sorry,I'm already spoiling her but diamond in the rough... Could your heart just melt?",Barney
8041,"Weird, right? Yeah. The same thing happened last week at the museum.",Barney
8042,"Ooh, ooh, ooh!",Lily
8043,Lily.,Barney
8044,You pretend to be a struggling young artist who needs a new muse.,Lily
8045,No. Marshall.,Barney
8046,You're a millionaire art thief casing the joint for a thrill money can no longer give you!,Marshall
8047,Oh. No. Robin.,Barney
8048,"You're going blind, and you're trying to soak up all the beauty in the world before the darkness descends.",Robin
8049,"Bingo! So, I was talking to this girl...",Barney
8050,"At this point, about 83%. Soon, these audio guides will be all that I have left.",Barney
8051,"My God, you are beautiful. How about I get you a headset so you can see with your ears like I do? I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds, but when I came back... Hmm.You know, I also love the smell of great art.",Barney
8052,Why does this keep happening?,Barney
8053,Maybe you're not as good a liar as you think you are.,Lily
8054,"Oh, really? Then why am I not in prison for perjury? But I don't want to talk about work. Something weird is going on here.",Barney
8055,Alan Alda. It was Alan Alda.,Barney
8056,You never gonna believe what just happened.,Lily
8057,"Who was that, um, guy from Mash? The main guy. What...? Hawkeye from Mash. How can I be blanking on this?",Barney
8058,Alan Alda?,Lily
8059,No.,Barney
8060,"Oh, my God. Where is she?",Barney
8061,She must have left. She...,Lily
8062,"Well, she-she said I hooked up with her? What was her name? What did she look like?",Barney
8063,"She didn't say her name, but she had blonde hair, boobs. Kind of trashy.",Lily
8064,Dead in the eyes with an aura of self-loathing and despair?,Barney
8065,Yes!,Lily
8066,"That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!",Barney
8067,"Some woman that I slept with and screwed over is trying to ruin my life. God, why is this happening to me?",Barney
8068,It's karma.,Lily
8069,"Nah, it's not Karma. She's stripping in Vegas. Plus, we're good.",Barney
8070,"Look, if you want to figure out who it is, why don't you just start by checking your list?",Ted
8071,"My list? Dude, do not pretend you're not the kind of guy who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with.",Barney
8072,I have one. It's called my marriage license.,Marshall
8073,"Come on, let's see the list.",Ted
8074,"Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list.",Barney
8075,"This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with. I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th. Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you. What do you think, Lil? You recognize the saboteur?",Barney
8076,"I don't know, Barney. I only saw her face.",Lily
8077,How many of these girls know they're being photographed?,Ted
8078,"All of them, but only about half buy a copy on the way out.",Barney
8079,"Oh, Barney, you're never gonna figure out which one of these is the mystery woman. All of these women have a right to hate you.",Lily
8080,"Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up. I mean, any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney and do this or that, or this and that, or do this with those in that... I mean, she should have known what she was getting into.",Robin
8081,Absolutely. And what I do with these women should be between me and them. And you guys. And Heloise. She helped me do the decoupage.,Barney
8082,"I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot.",Lily
8083,This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?,Barney
8084,"The top 64 women I've slept with, split into four regions. This tournament will systematically narrow down which girl has the most cause to hate my guts. Last girl standing has to be the saboteur.",Barney
8085,"Absolutely not, Barney. We are not going to make a game out of the women you've tricked into sleeping with you. No way!",Lily
8086,The girl who thought he had 12 hours to live has way more cause to ruin his life than the girl he faked proposed to.,Lily
8087,"It's fake proposal girl. I mean, she hired a wedding planner!",Robin
8088,It's 12 hours to live! That girl flew them both to Paris!,Ted
8089,"Oh, she only bought him a one-way ticket!",Robin
8090,"Okay, okay, everybody! Hands.",Barney
8091,Damn it!,Robin
8092,"Okay, toss up. &quot;Thought I was Jorge Posada,&quot; or &quot;You have my dead wife's kidney?&quot;",Barney
8093,Kidney!,Ted
8094,Jorge Posada!,Robin
8095,She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play!,Lily
8096,That's true...,Barney
8097,It's &quot;Dead wife's kidney.&quot; How are we even discussing this?,Marshall
8098,Fake baby!,Lily
8099,Lost at sea!,Marshall
8100,Fake baby!,Ted
8101,Lost at sea!,Marshall
8102,I was there. Trust me. It's fake baby.,Ted
8103,"Down to the sweet 16. And coming out of the Upper West Side, we have the number three seed, &quot;Girl who thought I owned Google,&quot; up against the number seven seed, &quot;Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor.&quot;",Barney
8104,You got to go scuba instructor.,Ted
8105,You're kidding me!,Robin
8106,She got the bends!,Ted
8107,"Yeah, she did.",Barney
8108,Evil twin!,Marshall
8109,Prince of Norway! How could it not be Prince of Norway?!,Ted
8110,"Barney, you're the tiebreaker.",Robin
8111,I'm going with Evil Twin.,Barney
8112,You're kidding me!,Ted
8113,"Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl twice. As Barney and Larney. Okay, we're down to the Final Four. What do you think, people? Come on, dig deep.",Barney
8114,Oh! I can't decide. It could be any one of them.,Robin
8115,Is that the blackboard from my classroom?,Lily
8116,Come on! Marshall?,Barney
8117,I'm tired and sad.,Marshall
8118,Mosby?,Barney
8119,"I want to call my mom, just tell her I love her.",Ted
8120,"Okay. Then this is as far as we get. The Final Four. It's got to be Meg, Anna, Kate or Holly. We are gonna track these girls down, and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar.",Barney
8121,You guys stole my blackboard!,Lily
8122,"Okay, there's her building. When she comes out, I'm gonna hide, and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar, we run like hell.",Barney
8123,No.,Lily
8124,What do you mean &quot;no&quot;?,Barney
8125,"That woman, like every woman in your Final Four, deserves an apology, and I'm not telling you if she's the one until hear you say, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;",Lily
8126,"Are you nuts? That would involve me speaking to a woman I've already had sex with, which, frankly, is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car.",Barney
8127,"Barney, you're doing this.",Lily
8128,"Lily, this girl hates me. I hooked up with her in an apartment I was pretending was my own, told her I loved her, and then ditched her there. She got arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail. Oh, crap, there she is! If she sees me, she's gonna k*ll me!",Barney
8129,"Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Hey, Meg! Over here! Look who it is! Yo old friend Meg: Barney! Barney?",Lily
8130,"If she k*ll me, I want you to go into my apartment, grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the East River.",Barney
8131,"Look, Meg, we need to talk.",Barney
8132,And I forgive you. I love you.,Barney
8133,"No! What's the matter with you? Get off of him! Look, she's not the one, but you still owe her an apol...",Lily
8134,"So you remember who this one is, right?",Barney
8135,Yes. You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect.,Lily
8136,"Right, and if you recall, her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I...",Barney
8137,"Yeah, I know, Barney, you showed me. And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present. So go over there and apologize.",Lily
8138,"Ah, there she is.",Barney
8139,Ooh and she's holding hot coffee. Maybe she'll throw it in your face.,Lily
8140,"You're really enjoying this, aren't you?",Barney
8141,I'm making a scrapbook.,Lily
8142,"Anna, hi.",Barney
8143,What Web site?,Barney
8144,"You're right, I do deserve that. That's all I came here to say. You know what? I don't care who knows about it. Excuse me. Excuse me. I, Ted Mosby, am a jerk to women. Tell your sisters. Tell your daughters to stay away! Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.",Barney
8145,"Okay, which one is this again?",Lily
8146,She's...,Barney
8147,Is it her?,Barney
8148,Smile.,Lily
8149,You look good. Have you lost weight?,Barney
8150,"We're down to the number one seed. I knew it was Holly. It had to be Holly. Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly.",Barney
8151,That is the worst thing you've ever done. That's the worst thing anyone has ever done.,Lily
8152,"But in my defense, she was kind of annoying.",Barney
8153,She's gonna k*ll you.,Lily
8154,Holly.,Barney
8155,So you're not mad at Barney? Don't you want an apology? An admission of guilt? Your truck back?,Lily
8156,"Well then, to the last Fourth of July weekend I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.",Barney
8157,We ruined their lives. And the worst part of it is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.,Lily
8158,"No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is.",Barney
8159,"Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up.",Robin
8160,That's not a bad idea.,Barney
8161,I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on.,Robin
8162,I don't know. That's a lot riding on a girl who giggles when she lies.,Ted
8163,I do not.,Robin
8164,Have you ever fallen asleep while eating ribs?,Ted
8165,"No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is.",Robin
8166,I'm in.,Barney
8167,"Okay, here's how it's gonna work. Now, Lily...",Robin
8168,"...she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation.",Robin
8169,"Talking, we should be talking. Words. Here are words. Why is this so hard? Laughter!",Barney
8170,"And then I'll come in, looking hot as all hell.",Robin
8171,"I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move.",Robin
8172,"Hey, there, how are you doing?",Barney
8173,"Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger.",Robin
8174,"Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?",Barney
8175,"Get your hand off my thigh, Barney.",Robin
8176,"It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin.",Barney
8177,You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?,Robin
8178,"Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?",Barney
8179,"No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom.",Robin
8180,"Uh, I'm going to go to the bathroom now, but, uh, when I come back we'll go to my place and have sex.",Barney
8181,"Dude, dude, dude, look. Blonde girl heading over to Robin right now. We are go.",Ted
8182,I don't know what to do with my hands. What do I normally do with my hands? <em>(Barney joins them at the booth)</em> Barney. I brought a copy of the bracket. Which one is she?,Marshall
8183,I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64.,Barney
8184,Not even on bracket. Cinderella story comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing. That'll warm your heart.,Marshall
8185,Are you okay?,Ted
8186,"I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize.",Barney
8187,"Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry.",Lily
8188,What? What?,Barney
8189,"Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other.",Robin
8190,So I apologized for nothing?,Barney
8191,"Yes, but it was a great apology. And a perfect way to end my scrapbook. I'm going to call this photo &quot;Barney's Redemption.&quot; Could you stop giving me the finger?",Lily
8192,A new car!,Ted
8193,"Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. g*n for eternity!",Barney
8194,You can't call g*n for eternity.,Robin
8195,I just called it.,Barney
8196,"You can't just call things, barney.",Robin
8197,I call that I can call things!,Barney
8198,"Hey, baby.",Lily
8199,Beer.,Marshall
8200,Are you okay?,Lily
8201,Beer.,Marshall
8202,"Okay, what happened?",Ted
8203,They always told me that working at a big law firm was like being at w*r...,Marshall
8204,"...You get out of law school, it's like getting out of boot camp. That first day at work, you're storming the beaches, full of piss and vinegar...",Marshall
8205,Totally.,Marshall
8206,Freakin' briefcases.,Marshall
8207,Totally empty. you?,Marshall
8208,Then you get in the trenches side by side with your buddies. And you feel a sense of camaraderie. But before too long...,Marshall
8209,"...the shells start to fall. Hello, Arthur.",Marshall
8210,"Arthur Hobbes is one of the senior partners at my firm, and he's... he's my boss. He seems like a nice guy, but he's got a nickname... a*tillery arthur.",Marshall
8211,It's going fine. How is yours?,Marshall
8212,"He is, he's in... just in his office next door.",Marshall
8213,"You, too. <em>(Arthur leaves Marshall's office)</em> You never know who's gonna get hit...",Marshall
8214,"It was brutal, But the worst was a few minutes later.",Marshall
8215,"Yeah, sorry.",Marshall
8216,"So that brings us to today. A little background. So I'm working on this report called &quot;Using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent to contest a class certification order based on a lack of commonality, numerosity...&quot;",Marshall
8217,"Dude, you lost us. Can't you just call it something cool like &quot;the ninja report&quot;?",Ted
8218,"Okay. yeah, fine, whatever. Um, so I'm supposed to turn in &quot;the ninja report&quot; yesterday. But I got insanely busy with other stuff, I didn't get a chance to finish it, and then this morning...",Marshall
8219,I gotta go.,Marshall
8220,And then...,Marshall
8221,He screamed at me.,Marshall
8222,"Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.",Lily
8223,"What, that's it? You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?",Barney
8224,"Barney, I have never been screamed at like that in my life.",Marshall
8225,"Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?",Ted
8226,"I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business.",Barney
8227,"Oh, baby, it's just not fair. You've been working so hard. Late nights, weekends. I never see you. We've barely made love in weeks. It's bad, guys, mama needs her sugar.",Lily
8228,"Look, Marshall, he screamed at you, you took it. He probably respects you more for it.",Robin
8229,"Yeah, about that... So Arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment... Face turning red, vein in his forehead about to burst, spittle flying like shrapnel. Everyone you work with walking by your office, peering in. And suddenly, I just felt all of it.",Marshall
8230,All of what?,Ted
8231,"All of it. The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment, and now I'm working for the bad guys instead. The fact that I am stuck in this job because of a mortgage I can barely afford on an apartment that is crooked. The fact that I am a grown man, and nobody, not even a*tillery Arthur, has the right to talk to me like that!",Marshall
8232,I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...,Marshall
8233,"Just because you weren't around for this, I called g*n for all eternity in Ted's car.",Barney
8234,Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.,Barney
8235,"I don't know what happened. There's just something about being yelled at like that, like I was being scolded by my dad. Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.",Marshall
8236,Is &quot;boy&quot; the right word?,Robin
8237,"I felt absolutely powerless. Flaccid... Hell, I... I felt castrated.",Marshall
8238,"God, you're hot right now.",Lily
8239,"And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report.",Marshall
8240,Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.,Barney
8241,How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?,Marshall
8242,Here's what I would do if I were you.,Robin
8243,"Hi, Arthur.",Robin
8244,"Yeah, I got it. Right here. I think it's gonna blow you away.",Robin
8245,So we good?,Robin
8246,Then why are you still in my office?,Robin
8247,"Okay, g*n violence might be the answer to everything up in Canada, Robin, but here in America, we solve our problems with words. Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy with a big eloquent speech defending human dignity. Like abraham Lincoln.",Ted
8248,"Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big, eloquent speech off the top of your head.",Marshall
8249,Observe.,Ted
8250,Arthur?,Ted
8251,"Justice, sir. You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights, the most fundamentally paramount of which is the right... Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount. One means highest, one means lowest.",Ted
8252,"Human beings have rights, and those rights are, um...",Ted
8253,There are certain justices that cannot or will not be inalienable... as such... for the future.,Ted
8254,"Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay? I can't have some big confrontation with Arthur. I need this job, i... I need the money.",Marshall
8255,"Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow, tell him off and then quit?",Ted
8256,"It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it.",Marshall
8257,"Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.",Barney
8258,"Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened.",Barney
8259,"Oh, snap.",Barney
8260,"Oh, my God.",Ted
8261,He peed on the conference table?,Marshall
8262,"Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website t*nk. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.",Barney
8263,That's it? that's the end of the story?,Marshall
8264,"No, no, of course not... he died.",Barney
8265,"How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?",Marshall
8266,"Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming.",Barney
8267,Chain of screaming?,Marshall
8268,"Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.",Barney
8269,I thought it was a chain of screaming.,Ted
8270,"It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle.",Barney
8271,I don't scream at Lily.,Marshall
8272,"And I don't scream at my kids, none of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.",Lily
8273,So it's not a circle.,Robin
8274,"Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?",Barney
8275,"Lily, I need your take on this. What... what should I do?",Marshall
8276,"Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...",Lily
8277,"Oh, God.",Barney
8278,"...When dealing with a bully, the most important thing is to be constructive and positive.",Lily
8279,"Hello, Arthur.",Lily
8280,"I have the ninja report right here. But Arthur, in the future, if you want someone to do their best work, try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation, but through encouragement, inspiration and respect.",Lily
8281,"Oh, you're damn right. You know what I'm gonna do when I get home?",Lily
8282,I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...,Lily
8283,...just throw her on the bed...,Lily
8284,...and drive her home like a pack of sled dogs!,Lily
8285,"It's bad, guys. Mama needs it bad.",Lily
8286,"You're right, baby, it's about respect. That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight. Can you give me that speech again?",Marshall
8287,I'm gonna drive her home like a pack of...,Lily
8288,"No, the other part, please.",Marshall
8289,"I have the ninja report right here, but...",Lily
8290,"Which of these carpets would look better in the new apartment? I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft. It would feel great on your bare feet......or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat rolling down your trembling bosom.",Lily
8291,"Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?",Ted
8292,"Shh, don't say my name. Lily can't know it's me. Just pretend you're talking to Stella. Be all lovey dovey.",Marshall
8293,"Hey, Stella. Sweetie, how's it going?",Ted
8294,"Not good, not good at all.",Marshall
8295,Where are you right now?,Ted
8296,"Right downstairs, come find me. Without Lily.",Marshall
8297,"Okay, I'll see you soon.",Ted
8298,I love you.,Marshall
8299,"I love you, too.",Ted
8300,"Wow, you two are already saying the &quot;l&quot; word, huh?",Lily
8301,Apparently.,Ted
8302,You hitting that?,Lily
8303,"I'm in trouble, Ted. Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.",Marshall
8304,"Um... it's a new car, so just be careful...",Ted
8305,"I did something stupid, can we just drive somewhere? I need to get away... just drive, man. Please just drive.",Marshall
8306,"It's just, this is a really good parking spot.",Ted
8307,Dude!,Marshall
8308,"Look, just tell me what happened first.",Ted
8309,"Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech that Lily told me to give, be firm but respectful? Well, it didn't totally go that way.",Marshall
8310,"There is a lot of ketchup on that burger. Sorry, what happened?",Ted
8311,"After we all finished talking last night, I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.",Marshall
8312,"Hey, marshall.",Barney
8313,How long have you been sitting there?,Marshall
8314,"If you go in there with Lily's kindergarten nonsense, you're gonna get torn apart. I'm here to save your life. you hungry?",Barney
8315,"Yeah, I was just about to order.",Marshall
8316,What do you want?,Barney
8317,A sandwich and gravy fries.,Marshall
8318,"A green tea with lemon for me, and for my friend here, the meatloaf, please.",Barney
8319,"No, I didn't want meatloaf.",Marshall
8320,"Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else.",Barney
8321,"No, I don't.",Marshall
8322,"Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.",Barney
8323,Who would I even scream at?,Marshall
8324,I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries.,Barney
8325,No.,Marshall
8326,"Hey, I was just heading to the bar. What are you guys doing out here?",Robin
8327,"Oh, I was just telling Ted a story.",Marshall
8328,"Ooh, I like stories. You want a lick? What?",Robin
8329,Is that ice cream cone big enough?,Ted
8330,"Uh, it's delicious enough.",Robin
8331,"Okay, so... Then I say to Barney...",Marshall
8332,"I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney.",Marshall
8333,"Yes, you are. That waiter is every boss and every bully who ever embarrassed or belittled you. And how dare he deny you the one thing that you want, that would make you happy at this moment. A sandwich and gravy fries.",Barney
8334,Marshall.,Barney
8335,Excuse me?,Marshall
8336,This is not what I ordered.,Marshall
8337,"I beg your pardon, sir, But I ordered a sandwich and gravy fries, And as the customer, I'm always right, so...",Marshall
8338,"Hey, what are you guys doing out here?",Barney
8339,"Oh sweet, can I get a toot?",Robin
8340,"Uh-uh. against car rules, it's against car rules!",Ted
8341,"Oh, Ted, relax, it's Cuban. People pay to have their car smell like this.",Barney
8342,"Well, that's just not true.",Ted
8343,"Oh, Marshall, switch seats with me. I called g*n for all eternity.",Barney
8344,You can't call g*n for eternity.,Robin
8345,"Well, that's funny, cause I did!",Barney
8346,It's case by case.,Robin
8347,"Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here!",Marshall
8348,"A 20% tip, really, for that waiter?",Barney
8349,"I don't know, Barney, he worked a triple, it just...",Marshall
8350,"I can't believe it! If you're not gonna yell at the waiter, Yell at me.",Barney
8351,What?,Marshall
8352,Yell at me.,Barney
8353,"I'm not gonna yell at you, Barney.",Marshall
8354,"What, you think you're gonna upset me? Please, give me your best sh*t.",Barney
8355,"Okay, fine... what, you want me to yell at you?",Marshall
8356,Yeah.,Barney
8357,"This is me yelling at you, Barney.",Marshall
8358,"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly landing on a leaf about three blocks away.",Barney
8359,"This is me yelling at you, Barney!",Marshall
8360,"Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content. Make it hurt.",Barney
8361,You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!,Marshall
8362,"No, something that's true-- come on. The man made you cry. Make me cry.",Barney
8363,Your mom's a slut!,Marshall
8364,Yes.,Barney
8365,"Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, Barney, but you and your brother clearly have different fathers, And you know why? It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!",Marshall
8366,Keep going.,Barney
8367,I don't care what you say. Bob Barker is not your father!,Marshall
8368,"Okay, now, well, that's just not cool.",Barney
8369,"Oh my god, Barney, I'm so sorry...",Marshall
8370,"No, I'm kidding... keep going.",Barney
8371,"Bob Barker's not your father! You've concocted this delusional idea that a game show host is your real father, and he's not! You were abandoned, Barney! You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it, and so now you never allow yourself to feel anything, and that's how you survive in this corporate world, and if I keep heading down this path, I'm gonna turn into you! And I don't want that! I don't want any of this! This is not why I became a lawyer. This is not the person that I wanted to be...",Marshall
8372,"... I quit, Arthur! I quit!",Marshall
8373,"Really, 'cause I didn't mean to attack you personally, It's just that i...",Marshall
8374,"Robin, you dropped a little ice cream...",Ted
8375,Dude!,Marshall
8376,I'm sorry.,Ted
8377,"Don't blame this on me, Marshall. I told you to yell at someone beneath you. The circle of screaming is... The chain of scr... Pyramid... the pyramid of screaming! The pyramid of screaming.",Barney
8378,"How am I supposed to tell lily? She supported me through three years of law school, and now is the time when I'm supposed to pay her back. Now we're gonna lose the apartment. The place where we were gonna raise our children. How am I supposed to tell the person who I love more than anything in this world that I've just thrown away our future?",Marshall
8379,"Everybody out, everybody out of the new car! Out of the new car!",Ted
8380,"Ted, screaming never solves anything.",Barney
8381,"I'm so sorry. I just lost it. But I can fix it. First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go in there on my hands and knees and beg for my job back.",Marshall
8382,"No, you're not.",Lily
8383,What?,Marshall
8384,"Marshall, our future isn't money or an apartment. And it's definitely not you being miserable at that horrible job. I'm just happy to have my husband back. We'll figure the rest out.",Lily
8385,I love you.,Marshall
8386,"I love you, too.",Lily
8387,You sure about this?,Marshall
8388,"Yeah, who needs a car in new york city, right?",Ted
8389,"Ted, I don't think I can accept...",Marshall
8390,"Marshall, don't make me scream at you.",Ted
8391,"Thanks a lot, buddy.",Marshall
8392,"You guys did it in the car, didn't...",Ted
8393,"Oh, yeah!",Marshall
8394,"Coming up next, 'Is your baby trying to k*ll you?'",Robin
8395,"So, I got up this morning, its freezing. So I walked over there. And I don't know why I am still talking. Because clearly we are all asking the same question. What in God's creation is going on with Robin's breasts.",Ted
8396,"I know, right, isn't that amazing? I spent half an hour making these happen. Its tape in there, cotton balls, half of a Nerf football, but it works, right?",Robin
8397,Totally. What's the occasion?,Lily
8398,And old friend from Canada is in town and I'm meeting him for a drink.,Robin
8399,Ooh! Somebody you went to Degrassi with?,Barney
8400,"No. Actually, he was my first boyfriend.",Robin
8401,Simon. I thought he was the coolest guy ever. He smelled like Drakkar. He could ollie on a skateboard. He had the most amazing collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. We spent the whole summer madly in love.,Robin
8402,"Tell me more. Tell me more. Like, did he have a car?",Barney
8403,"So he's the guy who... How shall I say this like a gentleman? Robin, did he take your maple leaf?",Marshall
8404,"No, it wasn't like that.",Robin
8405,"Sounds to me like he gave you your first &quot;O, Canada!&quot; face.",Barney
8406,"Wait, wait. Did he break up with you and tell you he's just not that Inuit?",Lily
8407,"Um, something about fur trapping.",Ted
8408,Did you ride his Zamboni?,Barney
8409,"Wait, wait, wait. Did he...? I think I'm out.",Marshall
8410,"Yeah, I'm also &quot;oot. Okay, now I'm really out.",Ted
8411,"Well, I'm sorry, guys. It was all very tame. We only dated for a week and a half.",Robin
8412,Wha...? I thought you said you were together all summer.,Barney
8413,"Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty much the last week of July. Anyway, one night, his band just finish playing this gig...",Robin
8414,"Oh, my God! Simon. That was such a good show. You guys totally rocked out.",Robin
8415,What?,Robin
8416,Louise Marsh?! That's a whore's name if I ever heard one.,Lily
8417,"Yeah, why would he want to get back together with Louise Marsh?",Marshall
8418,"Oh... So... I totally... I get it. Pools are great. Swimming's awesome. We have a sprinkler. Run right through it. Well, I should go.",Robin
8419,"Yeah, Simon?",Robin
8420,No! Tell me you did not load the drum set.,Ted
8421,I did.,Robin
8422,"And now he's coming here? Robin, why do you want to see this guy?",Marshall
8423,"Oh! I know why. You're gonna win, aren't you?",Lily
8424,I have no idea what you' talking about.,Robin
8425,"Yes, you do. Whenever you haven't seen someone for a long time, no matter how much you want to deny it, there's always a clear winner and a clear loser.",Ted
8426,"Well, since you brought it up, let's add up the points.",Robin
8427,You're starting out with two big ones right there.,Barney
8428,"Thank you. Okay. So, Simon still lives with his mom.",Robin
8429,Point Robin.,Ted
8430,"Um, he never became a rock star.",Robin
8431,Point Robin.,Lily
8432,He now works at a water slide park outside of Ottawa.,Robin
8433,Point Simon.,Marshall
8434,Wait. Do they have a wave pool?,Ted
8435,No.,Robin
8436,Ah. Point Robin. That's five-zip. There's no coming back from that.,Marshall
8437,"Yeah, he's going down. I mean, unless somehow, he got hotter. There he is.",Robin
8438,"Okay, what the hell just happened?",Ted
8439,"Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it?",Robin
8440,"Hey, Simon.",Robin
8441,"Yeah. You look great. You got hotter, like that's possible.",Robin
8442,"So... Look, I know it didn't go as planned, but I can't help it. I mean... he's still got it.",Robin
8443,"So he's not a snob. He's from a different part of Canada, you know? The maple leaf flag on the back of the pickup truck? He's Red Province. He's from the Deep North.",Robin
8444,"The thing is, we gave you so many opportunities.",Marshall
8445,"So, Simon, Robin's a bit of a local celebrity here in New York. She's the lead anchor at Metro News One. Tell him, Robin.",Lily
8446,"No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.",Robin
8447,"I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are nattering on about our big celebrity. What do you do for a living?",Barney
8448,Huh! A water slide park. That sure is different than what Robin does.,Ted
8449,Um... <em>(clears his throat</em>)... okay. Go.,Ted
8450,"No, I didn't know...",Ted
8451,"Oh, well, sure. I mean, if I was actually...",Ted
8452,"Well, that's cool. You got to pay the bills somehow since your whole music thing didn't really pan out, did it?",Lily
8453,The Foreskins are still playing?,Robin
8454,The Foreskins? How'd you guys come up with that name?,Ted
8455,I know. I'm sorry.,Robin
8456,"I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream.",Robin
8457,Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.,Barney
8458,"So, Simon, how did you guys meet?",Barney
8459,Starred in it is more like it.,Robin
8460,"I'm sorry. I've seen &quot;Let's Go to the Mall&quot; about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it.",Barney
8461,There's another video?!,Barney
8462,"Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape.",Barney
8463,No.,Robin
8464,"All right! You leave me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute ching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found.",Barney
8465,Okay.,Robin
8466,"It's just... It was so hard to watch, Robin. You're usually so cool.",Marshall
8467,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm sitting next to Simon, and suddenly I'm 16 again.",Robin
8468,"Oh, it's actually a common thing. When you're around someone from your past, you kind of revert back to who you were when you knew them. There's not really a name for it, though.",Ted
8469,It's called &quot;revertigo.&quot;,Marshall
8470,"Yeah, I don't know about &quot;revertigo.&quot;",Ted
8471,"You know who gets really bad revertigo? <em>(whispers)</em> Lily when she around her high school friend, Michelle.",Marshall
8472,Michelle? She sounds hot.,Barney
8473,You don't know about Lily and Michelle?,Ted
8474,No. What about Lily and Michelle?,Barney
8475,"Oh, my friend, you are in for a treat. Hey, Lil?",Marshall
8476,What?,Lily
8477,"You know, I was just thinking, we haven't seen your friend Michelle in a while.",Marshall
8478,"Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out.",Lily
8479,What... <em>(stammers</em>) Do they make out?,Barney
8480,Better.,Marshall
8481,Comparable.,Ted
8482,Comparable.,Marshall
8483,"Whatever. It's over. I lost. I guess you, uh, you don't get second chance.",Robin
8484,I got a second chance.,Robin
8485,What happened?,Lily
8486,He came by my place tonight...,Robin
8487,Simon. What are you doing here?,Robin
8488,"Oh, I like where this is going.",Robin
8489,"He asked you out?! Oh, step into my web, Simon.",Lily
8490,The coup de grace.,Ted
8491,Finish him!,Barney
8492,I'd love to!,Robin
8493,Wait. You're going on a date with Simon? That Simon?The one we met?,Ted
8494,"Robin, this guy doesn't deserve a second chance. Not after the way he treated you.",Lily
8495,"That was ten years ago. People evolve. I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school?",Robin
8496,"Oh, hell, no!",Lily
8497,I think you're gonna enjoy this.,Marshall
8498,That my girl Michelle?,Lily
8499,How she livin'?,Lily
8500,"Oh, girl, you gots to get your drink on up in here.",Lily
8501,For reals.,Lily
8502,"I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle.",Barney
8503,Yeah!,Robin
8504,That rocked.,Robin
8505,"Oh, uh, sure.",Robin
8506,"Oh, cool. I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning.",Robin
8507,"Oh, well, you know, it's not a show. It's the news.",Robin
8508,"And now it's time for &quot;Puppy Corner,&quot; some little angels looking for a new home, courtesy of the Midtown Animal Shelter.",Robin
8509,"Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted. Of course, a lot of the people calling in thought we were going to k*ll them.",Robin
8510,"Robin, your revertigo is really starting to affect your work.",Marshall
8511,What's revertigo?,Lily
8512,"It's a stupid, made-up word with no meaning.",Ted
8513,"No. It's a phenomenon where, when you're around people from your past, you start behaving like them.",Marshall
8514,Oh. One example of that springs to mind. I think we all know what it is.,Lily
8515,You do?,Marshall
8516,Yeah. Ted.,Lily
8517,Me?,Ted
8518,"Whenever Ted's friend Punchy comes into town, it's like, all of a sudden, Ted's in high school again.",Lily
8519,"Okay, okay. First of all, his name is Adam Punciarello, and I don't do that.",Ted
8520,"Ooh. That must be Adam. 'Sup, Punchy?",Ted
8521,You want to go?,Ted
8522,"Dude, seriously, I'm sorry about your dad.",Ted
8523,"I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this.",Ted
8524,Why?,Lily
8525,No reason.,Ted
8526,"Robin, the point is, what are you doing? I mean, this guy?",Marshall
8527,"Okay, you want the truth? Yeah. I like Simon. I do. We have fun together.",Robin
8528,"Oh, we know you do, honey, but we're worried about you.",Lily
8529,"You're worried? Okay, hold on. Is there any version of this conversation where you guys don't sound like my parents?",Robin
8530,I don't know. Is there any version where you don't sound like a 16-year-old?,Lily
8531,That's exactly what my mom would say.,Robin
8532,"No. If I was your mom, I woulsay, &quot;We forbid you from seeing this boy.&quot;",Lily
8533,Lily!,Robin
8534,"No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good.",Lily
8535,This is my life! You guys just don't get it! You've never felt the way that I feel!,Robin
8536,"Now, now. We were once young and in love, too.",Marshall
8537,"Yeah, like, a billion years ago.",Robin
8538,"You've been drinking, haven't you?",Lily
8539,"Yeah, we all have. You bought the last round.",Robin
8540,You're not going to that show tonight!,Lily
8541,"Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else? Tonight, after the show, Simon and I are going all the way.",Robin
8542,"Young lady, get back here! Thanks for your help.",Lily
8543,"Hey, so, today at work...",Ted
8544,"Not now, Ted!",Marshall
8545,Geez.,Ted
8546,"Oh, hey, Simon. Great show. You guys still rock.",Robin
8547,"God, I just love seeing you so happy.",Robin
8548,What?,Robin
8549,"Well... I'm sorry, Robin.",Ted
8550,"I'm fine, really.",Robin
8551,"Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real. Simon's a dawg. You feel me, Chelle?",Lily
8552,Mm. True dat. I'ma get me my champagne and grape soda on.,Lily
8553,"So, how's Columbia?",Ted
8554,"Um, can I make an observation?",Robin
8555,Revertigo?,Marshall
8556,All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter?,Barney
8557,Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show.,Robin
8558,"Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago.",Barney
8559,"No, tonight.",Robin
8560,"Ooh. Really? <em>(Robin starts crying)</em>Oh! Oh, come here.",Barney
8561,"It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again.",Robin
8562,"Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome.",Barney
8563,"Right. Of course, the-the first being you.",Robin
8564,No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.,Barney
8565,"Barney, do you want to come back to my place?",Robin
8566,Your place?,Barney
8567,Are you sure you want to do this?,Barney
8568,"Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?",Robin
8569,"Of course. So, should I just put it in?",Barney
8570,"Yeah, why not?",Robin
8571,This was my big artistic follow-up to&quot;Let's Go to the Mall.&quot; It kind of t*nk.,Robin
8572,Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more.,Barney
8573,"Oh, I'm so glad.",Robin
8574,Is that Alan Thicke?,Barney
8575,Yeah.,Robin
8576,"You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then?",Barney
8577,"Yeah, you're right. I was lame.",Robin
8578,"Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad.",Barney
8579,He was my sidekick. He had to be.,Robin
8580,"In my experience, the way this normally goes is, we lie here for a while, make a little awkward chitchat.",Barney
8581,Check.,Robin
8582,"Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery, rocket test flight I've got to be at, slip out of the apartment and never call you again.",Barney
8583,"And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, &quot;who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?&quot;",Robin
8584,"Actually, you usually say that out loud. So...I just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend",Barney
8585,And I just slept with my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.,Robin
8586,Best friend.,Barney
8587,"Okay, here's the deal, Barney. The second my feet touch the ground, this never happened.",Robin
8588,"Okay. Wait. Right click, save as... Into the.bpeg folder, and okay. This never happened. It's a good plan.",Barney
8589,Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.,Robin
8590,"Okay. Right. So, Robin?",Barney
8591,"Yes, Barney?",Robin
8592,Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?,Barney
8593,"I'm gonna shower... till June, and, um, since you were never here to begin with, you won't be here when I get out.",Robin
8594,Okay. This never happened. Never happened. Never... happened.,Barney
8595,"So, tell us, what was it like?",Ted
8596,What?,Barney
8597,"Penetrating that barrier. You and I are the first ones to hit it. Well, not the first ones, certainly, but the first ones at this table.",Ted
8598,I... I... I'm... I'm...,Barney
8599,"Although, I'm gonna be hitting it pretty soon.",Marshall
8600,"Yeah, you are.",Robin
8601,"Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts.",Marshall
8602,"It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there. I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there.",Lily
8603,What are you talking about?!,Barney
8604,"The big three-oh. You know, my 30th birthday's this friday. Did you forget? What kind of friend is this guy?",Ted
8605,"Ha-ha right. A great friend, by the way. The best. Is it my imagination, or are these drinks getting smaller? If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, &quot;try again.&quot; How you doing there, Robin?",Barney
8606,I'm good.,Robin
8607,"Oh, so, I made a a decision. I'm going to go through all my old stuff, And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore. Hmm. Barney, you want my xbox?",Ted
8608,"Ted, she has a name! And just what are you accusing me of?",Barney
8609,Liking video games?,Ted
8610,I'm gonna get a drink.,Robin
8611,I'll come with you.,Barney
8612,Okay.,Robin
8613,"God, this is awkward.",Barney
8614,What is?,Robin
8615,Being around Ted.,Barney
8616,Why?,Robin
8617,Because of our thing.,Barney
8618,What thing?,Robin
8619,You're really gonna pretend this never happened?,Barney
8620,What never happened? What are you guys talking about?,Ted
8621,Nothing.,Robin
8622,"Guys, cut the act. I know. I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me. Marshall let it slip earlier today. Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything. Just be sure to invite Stella.",Ted
8623,"Stella! You have a serious girlfriend now! You're over this one. Robin who, right? Stella makes this one look like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right? Happy birthday, bro.",Barney
8624,Hello.,Marshall
8625,"Hey, Marshall, I need your help.",Barney
8626,"Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now.",Marshall
8627,I know. I want to hire you.,Barney
8628,"For the last time, Barney, I will not be your butler.",Marshall
8629,I need a lawyer. I'll pay you.,Barney
8630,How much?,Marshall
8631,A little.,Barney
8632,I'll take it.,Marshall
8633,"Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say, this might be a little bit over my head. For one thing, I'm fairly certain that if these contracts aren't executed precisely, we will be at w*r with Portugal.",Marshall
8634,"Forget that. That's a Tuesday for me. New shredder. This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds. From sky mall. It's all from sky mall. Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall. Want a hot dog?",Barney
8635,Of course. Why are you upset?,Marshall
8636,"Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret that you can't tell anyone-- not Ted, not Robin, not Lily.",Barney
8637,"No. no, no, no, I don't want any more secrets, especially now that I know what you guys did to the drinking water in lisbon. I...",Marshall
8638,"You are hearing this secret, Marshall. I... I slept... <em>(Marshall covers his ears with his hands and starts singing)</em> Stop..stop doing that. <em>(Barney throws a bowling ball at him, Marshall catches it)</em> I slept... I slept with Robin.",Barney
8639,You slept with Robin?,Marshall
8640,Are you mad at me?,Barney
8641,I don't know.,Marshall
8642,How's the hot dog?,Barney
8643,"It's helping. You slept with Robin?! I... I cannot keep that secret. I mean, you know I at least have to tell Lily.",Marshall
8644,You can't. you can't tell anyone. Attorney-client privilege.,Barney
8645,Why are you doing this to me?!,Marshall
8646,"Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer, to prove that I didn't do anying wrong.",Barney
8647,"How can I help you as your lawyer? You didn't break any laws, did you? Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?",Marshall
8648,"I didn't break any state or federal laws, but I think I broke a much, much higher law. The Bro Code.",Barney
8649,Bro Code article one:&quot;Bros before hoes.&quot;,Barney
8650,"Bro Code article 89: &quot;The mom of a bro is always off limits, but the stepmom of a bro is fair game if she initiates it, and/or is wearing at least one a article of leopard print clothing.&quot;",Barney
8651,Bro Code article 34: &quot;Bros cannot make eye contact during a devil's three-way.&quot; Two dudes.,Barney
8652,This is not a legal docume.. This is just something you wrote.,Marshall
8653,"You think I wrote that? Oh, Marshall, don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?",Barney
8654,The year was 1776. The place: Philadelphia. Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were hangng a drink.,Barney
8655,I shall write this set of rules. And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution. To save paper.,Barney
8656,And I shall l include a provision that stateth &quot;No eye contact in a devil's three-way.&quot;,Barney
8657,"Listen, what do you want me for?",Marshall
8658,"I've just been losing my mind lately, and do you know why I feel so bad?",Barney
8659,"Yeah, because you slept with Robin.",Marshall
8660,"No, that was awesome. I feel bad because the Bro Code clearly states &quot;No sex with your bro's ex.&quot; But if you, my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere, then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.",Barney
8661,And you would pay me for that?,Marshall
8662,"No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork. Technically, you'll be paid by a toy factory in Pyongyang.",Barney
8663,"Barney, I'm no shrink, okay, but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?",Marshall
8664,"Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation, I'd hire the guy we pay to hint notize us before depositions. Now, get cracking!",Barney
8665,"And with a little luck, in a few days, Farmer Frank's cold will be all gone. And that's why Farmer Frank's breath smells like medicine. Right, Farmer Frank?",Lily
8666,Any last questions for Farmer Frank? Yes.,Lily
8667,"I know, I know. I already called an animal rescue, and they're going to come get her on Monday.",Lily
8668,"Monday?! Where's she going to sleep and eat and go to the bathroom?! Okay, where's she going to sleep and eat?",Ted
8669,I-I guess I'll keep her up on the roof.,Lily
8670,"Look, call me crazy. I just... I don't think having a goat in the apartment is a good idea.",Ted
8671,"Hey, Ted. You ready to, um... Where'd the goat turd come from?",Robin
8672,How'd you know that was a goat turd?,Ted
8673,"Well, it was either that, or a musk ox turd, and I figured,what the hell would a musk ox be doing in here?",Robin
8674,Hey. Guess what your wife brought home.,Ted
8675,Attorney-client privilege.I can't talk about it.,Marshall
8676,Talk about what?,Ted
8677,"Nothing. How was your day? Oh, goat turd on the floor,I see. Is that new?",Marshall
8678,How does everyone know that's a goat turd?,Ted
8679,Barney told you.,Robin
8680,"I don't know what you're talking about,madam.",Marshall
8681,"Marshall, you can't look me in the eye, you're blushing, coughing, and your hands are shaking.",Robin
8682,"Robin, come here!",Ted
8683,"Ted is never finding out about this, you understand? Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything. And don't even think about opening that can until I'm out of the splash zone.",Robin
8684,"Fantastic, you're here. Give me the good news.",Barney
8685,I'm sorry. You did too good of a job writing this thing. It's-it's iron-clad.,Marshall
8686,"No! Bad lawyer! I need a loophole! I want to feel better, Marshall! I can't keep buying things! I have six self-cleaning litterboxes and I don't even have a kid. Wait. How about this? Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right? And if he's broken the Bro Code, then I'm off the hook.",Barney
8687,"I thought about that. And I gotta say, Ted has upheld this thing time and time again. For example, article 87: &quot;A bro shall at all times say yes.&quot;",Marshall
8688,Yes.,Ted
8689,Yes.,Ted
8690,Da.,Ted
8691,Article 29 &quot;A bro will in a timely manner alert his bro to the existence of a girl fight.&quot;,Marshall
8692,"Dude, two girls are fighting at MacLaren's.",Ted
8693,What?!,Barney
8694,"Yeah, yeah. It was crazy. This one girl was like... Oh, hey.",Ted
8695,Hey.,Barney
8696,"Article 53: &quot;A bro will, whenever possible, provide his bro with protection.&quot;",Marshall
8697,Good.,Barney
8698,"Yeah. I wish we had some wine, too.",Barney
8699,"Damn it, Marshall. I'm not paying you to tell me what a saint Ted is! You're my lawyer! The answer is in there! Find it!",Barney
8700,"Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it. The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong. And the only way you're ever gonna feel any better about it is if you tell Ted what you did.",Marshall
8701,What if he never wants to talk to me again?,Barney
8702,"Well, I guess that's just a chance you're gonna have to take.",Marshall
8703,"Hey, where are you?",Lily
8704,"I'm in the limo, right outside of Ted's office.",Barney
8705,"Great. Well, everyone's here. Stella just arrived and there is something here so awesome, I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you won't believe...",Lily
8706,Goat in a party hat?,Barney
8707,"Damn it! Well, you still gotta see it. It's so much fun having a goat at a party!",Lily
8708,"Uh, gotta go. Here he comes.",Barney
8709,Okay. Bye.,Lily
8710,"Whoa, you guys went all out.",Ted
8711,"Okay, everyone, Ted's in the limo, five-minute warning! Everyone get ready! Oh, Missy, are you excit?? Yes, you are!",Lily
8712,"Whoa, we're leaving the city. Where the hell is this party?",Ted
8713,Vegas.,Barney
8714,Vegas? I thought the party was on the rooftop.,Ted
8715,"Surprise! Just a decoy, my friend.",Barney
8716,So there's no roof party?,Ted
8717,"Oh, no. There is. We're just not going. This is how good a friend I am. They want you to spent your 30th standing around drinking flat beer ten feet above your living room. But not me, bro. I pulled out all the stops. Private jet, Valderrama suite at the Bellagio. Steaks at BOA, scotch at Ghostbar, then two ringside seats to watch Floyd Mayatather go ten rounds with, wait for it... a grizzly bear!",Barney
8718,"Take me home, Barney.",Ted
8719,"No! We have to go to Vegas. Look, Ted, I didn't want to say this, but... there's something that I have to tell you, and I wanted you to be in the best possible frame of mind before you heard it.",Barney
8720,You slept with Robin.,Ted
8721,When did you find out?,Barney
8722,"Hey, Robin. Come here!",Ted
8723,What's up?,Robin
8724,"I was, uh, just going through some old stuff and I...",Ted
8725,"Oh, crap!",Marshall
8726,"Anyway, uh, I came across this.",Ted
8727,From my vacacation in Vermont.,Robin
8728,"Yeah. I don't know if you'd even want it, but if you do, it's yours.",Ted
8729,I slept with Barney!,Robin
8730,What?,Ted
8731,"It was just one time, it, it was the night that Simon dumped me and I was in a really vulnerable place and I, I wanted to just pretend like it never happened, but I couldn't, and... I can't. I just, I had to tell you. And... I just hope that we can still be friends.",Robin
8732,Of course we can still be friends.,Ted
8733,So you're not mad?,Robin
8734,"Well, I'm... it's a little weird, but, um... No, I'm not mad.",Ted
8735,So you're not mad?,Barney
8736,"No, I'm not mad. I mean, Robin and I broke up a year ago. We've, we've both dated lots of people since then. I'm with Stella now. Seriously, I...I'm fine with this.",Ted
8737,I'm so relieved to hear you say that.,Barney
8738,"Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hey, I just remembered, um, my mom is coming into town next month. Maybe you'd like to nail her, too!",Ted
8739,Where are they?! I'm getting a cramp.,Marshall
8740,"Marshall, can we keep the goat?",Lily
8741,No.,Marshall
8742,But she's so cute and furry and soft.,Lily
8743,"Yeah, and she also sheds, eats out of the garbage and can't control her bobowels.",Marshall
8744,Why don't we just call Duluth Mental Hospital and say my Uncle Linus can live with us?,Lily
8745,"Yeah, Lily, that may seem like a good idea after a couple of drinks but tomorrow morning you're going to want this thing out of your house.",Robin
8746,"Oh, you should talk.You slept with Barney.",Lily
8747,Marshall!,Robin
8748,I'm sorry! I couldn't take it anymore.,Marshall
8749,I can't believe you did that. That's so gross. Was it amazing?,Lily
8750,"What? I... Lily, I really don't want to talk about this.",Robin
8751,I know but it's Barney. It's just hard not to be curious. Did he have like devices and stuff?,Lily
8752,"Lily,come on.",Robin
8753,Hot wax?,Lily
8754,Stop it.,Marshall
8755,Did he tie you to anything?,Lily
8756,That's enough. What's wrong with you?,Marshall
8757,I'm sorry. Is he all smooth down there?,Lily
8758,Three billion women on the planet! Three billion! And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?! Robin?!,Ted
8759,You think I'm proud of this?! I'm horrified that this happened.,Barney
8760,"How did it happen? Huh? Barney, I want to know. Tell me exactly how it happened.",Ted
8761,You mean... what position? <em>(They starts fighting)</em> Stop it! Stop it!,Barney
8762,Ted! Stop!,Barney
8763,Stop!,Barney
8764,"Okay. Okay. You're pissed. You deserve to be. Fine. You know what? One free sh*t. On me. Anywhere but the face. <em>(Ted hits him where it hurts the most...)</em> Who punches someone in the groin? Okay.Okay. I deserved that. I deserved that. But what's important now is... we're passed this whole Robin thing now, right?",Barney
8765,"You think that this is just about Robin? This is about... You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff. I mean some really terrible stuff to a lot of different people. I just always thought there had to be a limit. I always thought I was the limit. You're always spouting off these rules for bros. Isn't one of them, &quot;don't do this&quot;?",Ted
8766,"Yeah. And I broke it. I'm sorry. But, Ted...seriously, this suite at the Bellagio...",Barney
8767,"I am not going to Vegas with you! I'm not going to blow off my friends and my girlfriend, and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club. The fact that you think I would... You know, Barney,earlier this week I started putting things in a box and that box was labeled &quot;stuff I have no use for anymore.&quot;",Ted
8768,What does that mean?,Barney
8769,It means... maybe you belong in that box.,Ted
8770,Are you saying you don't want to be bros anymore?,Barney
8771,I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.,Ted
8772,"Okay, I'm going to stop you right there, because it seems like you're about to say something that's going to pretty much ruin Vegas.",Barney
8773,"Ranjit, stop the car. I'm getting a cab.",Ted
8774,Are you saying you don't wanna be bros anymore?,Barney
8775,I'm saying I don't wanna be friends anymore.,Ted
8776,"It's Barney. (To Barney, in the phone) Dude, seriously you need to stop calling me.",Ted
8777,"(in the phone) Yeah I never called you, you called me fifteen times and my parents twice.",Ted
8778,"I'm sorry, I gotta let you go. It's just too many good wingmen out there. Ted are you crying?",Barney
8779,No I'm not.,Ted
8780,"Sh! Let it out, let it out.",Barney
8781,Goodbye Barney. (He hangs up),Ted
8782,So are you two back together?,Lily
8783,No.,Ted
8784,I miss Barney. I haven't &quot;high five&quot; with anyone like a week. I think I might be starting to lose my fist bone careless.,Marshall
8785,Let me ask you something Ted. Why are you so much madder at Barney than me?,Robin
8786,Yeah! She had just as much sex with Barney as Barney had with her.,Lily
8787,You know what? I'm not sure that's true. I think I actually prefered if you are mad at me. This is too weird.,Robin
8788,I'm not mad at anybody. I've forgiven you. And I've outgrown Barney as a friend. It's that's simple.,Ted
8789,I will tell you why he is not mad. Because he is so happy with Stella.,Lily
8790,"You guys haven't had sex yet!!?? When Marshall and I were two months, we were doing it 24/7.",Lily
8791,"I know, I was in the top bunk. Also sat next to you at football games.",Ted
8792,So what you guys waiting for?,Lily
8793,"I think she wants to make sure we are serious first, that's why she hasn't introduced me to her daughter either. She wants to take things slow.",Ted
8794,"Wait, so you haven't had sex since like Thanksgiving. Do you know how many big federal holidays have come and gone since then.",Marshall
8795,"Oh baby, do you remember Martin Luther King day?",Lily
8796,"Yeah, I do. We ode that dude big time.",Marshall
8797,"Look, I'm crazy about this girl, if waiting is what it takes, then I'm fine with that. And totally unrelated note. Does anybody have gamma icer or a piece of bark that you are not chewing?",Ted
8798,"No offence Randy, but there is a long list of candidats for this slot. This slot is for vice president of awesome. And you are like assistant under secretary of only ok.",Barney
8799,"(in the phone) Pitt, Barney Stinson!",Barney
8800,"Yeah. Yeah. So, listen you should meet me in McLaren's tonight.",Barney
8801,So what do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock? (They both hang up),Barney
8802,"Starry Porten, Barney Stinson.",Barney
8803,"I need a new bro, what do you say?",Barney
8804,"Oh, I understand. Duck Stan is a good bro. I'm happy for you. Best of luck. (He hangs up)",Barney
8805,Crazy Willie! Barney Stinson.,Barney
8806,Yes finally!,Barney
8807,Hanging up on you once wasn't enough. (And then Barney hangs up),Barney
8808,"Let's have sex. Right now, I'll lock the door.",Ted
8809,"We can do it against the door. It'll be hot! It'll be like a three-way: you, me and the door.",Ted
8810,I'm sorry. We're waiting. It's cool.,Ted
8811,I was afraid of this. You're 14.,Ted
8812,Wow. It's funny that you say that. Me too.,Ted
8813,It's been a while.,Ted
8814,It's been five months for you too?,Ted
8815,"Wow. Stella hasn't had sex since 2003. Let's just put this in context. The last time Stella had sex, the movie, Seabiscuit, had just galloped into the theaters... and our hearts.",Marshall
8816,"Five years! God, if I even went one year, I would be out on the street selling it for a nickel.",Lily
8817,"The last time Stella had sex, the world was just learning about SARS.",Marshall
8818,"Well, Ted, what else did she said? Did she gave you any kind of explanation?",Robin
8819,But nobody in five years?,Ted
8820,"In my defense, they were staring at me.",Ted
8821,So what does this mean for you? Is she ever wanna want to get intimate?,Lily
8822,Actually...,Ted
8823,Your pillow talk's a little rusty.,Ted
8824,That's great. Like &quot;right now&quot; ready? (She laughs),Ted
8825,"So, her sister's driving up to baby-sit Lucy, and we're getting a hotel room in the city Saturday night.",Ted
8826,"The last time Stella had sex, The Da Vinci Code had just come out.",Marshall
8827,Well that's doesn't seem like that long ago.,Robin
8828,"Not the movie, the book.",Marshall
8829,Wow.,Robin
8830,"It's a lot of pressure, isn't it?",Ted
8831,You know what? It's not. This woman needs it bad. Anything you do is going to be fireworks. I remember my longest drought...,Lily
8832,(V.O.) It was that summer I lived in San Francisco. I hadn't had been with Marshall since two months and 19 days. (There is a shock. And Lily likes the sensation which that gets her.),Lily
8833,"Oh, San Francisco!",Lily
8834,"I don't know Lily, after five years, her expectations have gotta be pretty high.",Ted
8835,I really gonna have to bring my A-game to satisfy this woman.,Ted
8836,"Yeah, it'll be pretty hard now that she's dead.",Robin
8837,Not Nell Carter... Stella.,Ted
8838,"Dude, relax, it's all about expectations management. Do you know why I hated Jerry Maguire so much?",Marshall
8839,Because you're dead inside?,Ted
8840,"No, because you built it up for, like, two weeks, saying it was the greatest movie ever. With Stella, do the opposite: lower expectations.",Marshall
8841,"Right, right, and then no matter what happens, she'll be happy.",Ted
8842,No. (And hangs up),Robin
8843,"Hey, Randy. Could you come here for a minute? (Randy releases a box. And comes in Barney's office by running) Good news. I'm calling you up to the majors. Starting tomorrow night, how would you like to be my new wingman?",Barney
8844,I have a surprise appetizer for us today. Check it out. Potato skins.,Ted
8845,"Yeah. Right? God, it's been forever since I had potato skins. I remember them as being pretty much the most delicious things ever. (He eats the potato skin) Huh. That's surprising.",Ted
8846,"This potato skin. It's good but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head. Even though potato skin performed admirably, and is a totally respectable size... I couldn't enjoy it because of my own unrealistic expectations.",Ted
8847,No.,Ted
8848,No.,Ted
8849,"No. It's just that this is a big deal for you. I mean, it's like your virginity: the sequel. (She laughs)",Ted
8850,"Exactly, and I don't want to mess it up. I don't want you to ever wonder if was worth it.",Ted
8851,&quot;Unexpected number of testicules?&quot;,Ted
8852,Hey.,Barney
8853,"No, uh-uh. Randy, we never use the word &quot;bro&quot; in the name of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate.",Barney
8854,"You know what? I'm excited about this, Randy. You will be my next masterpiece. It's like with Ted. When I first met him, he was an even bigger loser than you.",Barney
8855,"But tonight, I'm going to make you the greatest wingman in the history of wingmen.",Barney
8856,"Oh, okay, Randy, let's do this. (Barney wants to pick up two young woman)",Barney
8857,You ready?,Barney
8858,What? What's the matter?,Barney
8859,Randy what are you doing?,Barney
8860,"(Finally Randy is ready, so Barney goes talking to the girls) Hey, laddies. Have you met... (He points the finger towards Randy and turns around. But Randy hid under a table.)",Barney
8861,Hey.,Ted
8862,"So, here's the plan. Take a horse-drawn carriage through the park, and it just so happens the Philharmonic is playing an open-air...",Ted
8863,Straight to the hotel?,Ted
8864,I'll get my bag. (Ted go to his bedroom),Ted
8865,Hey.,Lily
8866,"Hey. So, uh, looking forward to tonight?",Marshall
8867,Yeah. We heard. I would explode if it had been that long since I had a &quot;night out&quot;.,Lily
8868,This one wakes me up at 4am sometimes just to have a little night out.,Marshall
8869,Nothing. Pizza. What are you talking about?,Lily
8870,Hey guys.,Ted
8871,Told them what?,Ted
8872,You haven't had sex in five years??!! That is a shocking revelation that we're just finding out right now!,Marshall
8873,"Stella, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told them. But they're my best friends. I tell them everything. I-I didn't even think about it.",Ted
8874,"No, they don't.",Ted
8875,13 years??!!,Barney
8876,You can trust me.,Ted
8877,"Wait, did I gave you a reason or were you looking for one?",Ted
8878,"So I threw the pressure air oxygen into its mouth. I sh**t the t*nk, boo, nomore shark. Mr. Hall and I swam back to shore. Hey,let me serve you a drink.",Barney
8879,So where were we?,Barney
8880,Again? Really? Wait...,Barney
8881,"Hey, excuse me. Did I sleep with you and then totally screw you over?",Barney
8882,What are you doing on Friday?,Barney
8883,Stop! Amy?,Barney
8884,Riiiggghhhttt!!!,Barney
8885,A rainbow! That's beautiful! What a beautiful rainbow! Another rainbow? It's beautiful!,Lily
8886,"You're kidding me. Seriously, aren't you sick of these things?",Lily
8887,"Hey, how was your day?",Ted
8888,"Today, I yelled at a little girl for painting a rainbow.",Lily
8889,A rainbow? Sounds like that bitch had it coming.,Ted
8890,"So, uh, I just met with the contractor. and it turns out, that fixing the floors of the new apartment is going to cost a lot more than the estimate.",Marshall
8891,But we can barely afford that to begin with.,Lily
8892,"I hate to say this, but I think you're going to have to sell your stuff.",Marshall
8893,"Whoa! Marshall, that's just a game we play in the bedroom.",Lily
8894,I mean your clothes. All those designer pieces and everything.,Marshall
8895,What? Why just my clothes?,Lily
8896,"We can sell my stuff, too, but I got to tell you, I think your Marc Jacobs cocktail dress is going to go for a lot more than my &quot;Split Happens&quot; bowling shirt.",Marshall
8897,Dude.,Ted
8898,I'm not selling that. I've already made the Website.,Marshall
8899,You made a Website?,Lily
8900,"Yeah, it's called &quot;Lily-and-Marshall-sell- their-stuff-dot-com.&quot;",Marshall
8901,"No, you know what would be a better name for the site? Guy-forces-his-wife- to-dress-in-a-garbage-bag- for-the-next- three-years-dot-com. That's real.",Lily
8902,I'm worried. That woman is actually wearing a-a garbage bag.,Marshall
8903,"Hmm, but, girlfriend, you cannot pull off a tall kitchen.",Lily
8904,Why are you trying to ruin my life?,Barney
8905,And?,Barney
8906,"That's it? As far as I'm concerned, if I leave you safe on dry land with adequate transportation home, you've got nothing to complain about.",Barney
8907,"Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley.",Barney
8908,"Abby. A few weeks ago, Ted dumped me as his wingman. You had a crush on him for a couple weeks? I was Ted's best friend for seven years.",Barney
8909,Seven years!,Barney
8910,Ted. What an idiot. With his stupid &quot;meaningful relationship&quot; with Stella.,Barney
8911,I hate Ted more.,Barney
8912,Probably not quite as much.,Barney
8913,I'm sorry I yelled out &quot;Abby.&quot;,Barney
8914,"Oh, cool.",Barney
8915,This is insane. Has Lily even worn half this stuff?,Ted
8916,"Oh, yeah, like there's nothing in your closet you've never worn?",Robin
8917,"As a matter of fact, no, there isn't.",Ted
8918,"Whatever, red cowboy boots.",Robin
8919,Those are nice boots. I totally pull those off.,Ted
8920,"Hey, Lil, if I were to say &quot;Ted could never pull them off,&quot; What would I be talking about?",Marshall
8921,His red cowboy boots.,Robin
8922,I totally pull them off! It's a classic Western look.,Ted
8923,"Oh, okay, uh, today's category: classic Westerns that involve red cowboy boots. Ooh, ooh! Robin.",Marshall
8924,"&quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Fabulous.&quot;",Robin
8925,&quot;The Magnificent Kevin.&quot;,Lily
8926,&quot;No Country for Straight Men.&quot;,Marshall
8927,I don't want to sell my clothes!,Lily
8928,"Oh, I know, sweetie. Come here. Is this a hundred percent silk?",Robin
8929,"Lily,listen, we really need the money. I have some leads on a job, but until then, I just... I don't know what else we can do.",Marshall
8930,I'll sell my paintings!,Lily
8931,What?,Marshall
8932,"Yeah, I'll sell my paintings. Good oil paintings go for like, $500.",Lily
8933,Yeah. Totally. But...,Marshall
8934,I love it. It's a masterpiece. That's it. We're selling the TV. I just want to come home and stare at this all day. Aw. Somebody call the cops! My wife stole an awesome painting from the museum!,Marshall
8935,...that kind of money only goes for real paintings.,Marshall
8936,What does that mean?,Lily
8937,"Look, it just, it just means that-that we need money right now and I'm not sure that selling your paintings is-is how we're going to get it.",Marshall
8938,You don't believe in me.,Lily
8939,"No, wait, wait! Of c... of course I believe in you!",Marshall
8940,"Marshall, I am proud of my work as an artist. My paintings are good. I bet Robin would buy one. What now?",Lily
8941,"I love your painting, I just... I'm trying to be realistic.",Marshall
8942,"Well, how much money do we need for the contractor to finish the job?",Lily
8943,"About 1,500 bucks.",Marshall
8944,"Okay. So, if I can sell three of my paintings at 500 bucks a pop, then I get to keep all my clothes.",Lily
8945,"Babe, we need money fast.",Marshall
8946,"Well, give me a week.",Lily
8947,"Okay, a-a week.",Marshall
8948,Fine.,Lily
8949,Fine.,Marshall
8950,Pulling... Them... Off.,Ted
8951,You do?,Lily
8952,It's not for sale! My clothes are not for sale!,Lily
8953,We've been sitting here for hours and nobody's even glanced at my painting. Come on. Let's start talking it up.,Lily
8954,Wow! I really like that painting! It's neat! The-the colors are neat. The-the shapes are neat. It's really just... neat. What?,Robin
8955,"Observe. I think there's a dynamic quality to the brushwork that, combined with the fluid composition, creates an almost Kandinsky-like emotional resonance.",Ted
8956,"Yes, and you can still enjoy it even if you're not a pretentious douche.",Robin
8957,Can you clarify something for me about your critique? Are the colors &quot;neat&quot; or are they more &quot;neato burrito?&quot;,Ted
8958,"Uh, then again, red cowboy boots.",Robin
8959,I pull these off! (<em>Everyone is laughing at him)</em> I pull these off!,Ted
8960,What?,Barney
8961,You know what I hate most about Ted?,Barney
8962,"How he's always like, &quot;Oh, I want to fall in love and have a relationship. I care about the people I have sex with.&quot; He's so lame.",Barney
8963,You know what he needs? He needs to see just how horrible he is when he's in a relationship.,Barney
8964,I think so.,Barney
8965,Painting for sale! $500! Lifelong dream hanging in the balance! It's like they don't even see us.,Lily
8966,"Oh, I'm trying to fix the hardwood floors in my new apartment. You?",Lily
8967,Do you like heroin?,Lily
8968,"Thanks for your honesty, Crazy Sock Guy. Oh, I'm never gonna sell this...",Lily
8969,"500 bucks! Who's a real painter now, Marshall?",Lily
8970,"Honey, I never said you weren't a real painter.",Marshall
8971,"Oh, I know, sweetie. And since I'm a professional artist now, I'm going to sketch you an Aldrin original, you know, to say thanks for being such a supportive husband. I'm thinking about calling it... &quot;Suck It!&quot;",Lily
8972,"Lily, come on. I'm proud of you. Who-who bought it?",Marshall
8973,"Well, that's the best part. A gay couple without kids. A G-CWOK!",Lily
8974,You bagged a G-CWOK?!,Ted
8975,"Yeah, that's right. They are the heart and soul of the art-buying community.",Lily
8976,You know what you should do? You should call up the G-CWOKs and offer them a free painting if they throw a private art party for all their G-CWOK friends.,Ted
8977,"That's an amazing idea. I'm going to go call them. I can probably sell two more paintings with time to spare. Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something I had to tell you. What was it? Oh, that's right. Suck it.",Lily
8978,"Ted, fancy bumping into you here. Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby?",Barney
8979,"Uh, yeah.",Ted
8980,"Hi, Abby.",Barney
8981,"Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now?",Ted
8982,"That's right. I am done with this whole being awesome thing. Now I'm all about farmers' markets and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie?",Barney
8983,"Abby and I are in love. Not hot passionate love. Couple love. You know, movie night with my girlfriend, then waiting for her to go to bed so I can steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor.",Barney
8984,"You don't have to say it, though.",Barney
8985,"Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop.",Ted
8986,"Stop what, Ted? Stop being in love? Next he'll ask us to stop breathing.",Barney
8987,"Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing. Please stop.",Ted
8988,"Not before I share with you what being in a relationship leads to, Ted. Abby, Pookie Bear... I am so pathetically desperate for you that... aw, heck, I'll just say it. Would you marry me?",Barney
8989,I would never joke about true love.,Barney
8990,Okay.,Barney
8991,That's you.,Barney
8992,"Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding.",Ted
8993,"Uh, yes, she does.",Barney
8994,Totally committed to the bit.,Barney
8995,"Yes, Lily Aldrin. I sold you the painting earlier today.",Lily
8996,You sound happy.,Lily
8997,"Well, I just wanted to offer you an exclusive chance to view some of my other paintings.",Lily
8998,What?,Lily
8999,So... y-you didn't like my painting?,Lily
9000,"Okay. Well, if you didn't want the painting, can I... can I at least get it back?",Lily
9001,Where is it? I see. H-He threw out my painting.,Lily
9002,"This is great. My dream of becoming an artist is dead, and now I'm watching my wardrobe disappear piece by piece. There goes my favorite dress. This dress meant a lot to me.",Lily
9003,Really?,Robin
9004,Yeah. It was spring of 2004 and I had been having a hard few months.,Lily
9005,I got a two-syllable &quot;damn&quot; in this dress.,Lily
9006,A two-syllable &quot;damn.&quot; That's the dream.,Robin
9007,Yeah. Now she belongs to... CanadaGirl(a)MetroNewsOne.com.,Lily
9008,It's still in the family.,Robin
9009,"Lily, you're not going to believe this. Something amazing happened.",Marshall
9010,What?,Lily
9011,I went to the G-CWOK's apartment.,Marshall
9012,Really? Why?,Lily
9013,Because I felt guilty. This auction was my idea and now you've had to sit around all day while a bunch of vultures ruthlessly pick apart the carcass of your wardrobe.,Marshall
9014,It's still in the family.,Robin
9015,"And more importantly, I honestly love that painting and I couldn't stand to think of it in a trashcan someplace.",Marshall
9016,"Well, what happened?",Lily
9017,"Hi, um... Lawrence. I-I'm here about the painting my wife Lily solyou-- the one in the nice frame.",Marshall
9018,"Yeah, we get it. Gay guys like you.",Lily
9019,"No, Lily, they love me, but that's not the important part.",Marshall
9020,Here's the important part.,Ted
9021,"Since you're clearly a man of impeccable taste and style, I-I came down here to ask you: what do you think of the boots?",Ted
9022,I'll be in the cab.,Ted
9023,G-CWOK-approved.,Ted
9024,The painting!,Lily
9025,"Right, so, um, they told me they threw it in the building's Dumpster.",Marshall
9026,"It wasn't in there, but the super told me that he'd seen one Dr. Greer-- a veterinarian who works in the building-- take the painting out of the trash.",Marshall
9027,Dr. Greer? Who's Dr. Greer a-and why did he take my painting?,Lily
9028,You're about to find out.,Marshall
9029,"Ooh, we don't need the details.",Lily
9030,Really? Dogs like my paintings?,Lily
9031,"Anyway, because your first painting worked so well, I convinced Dr. Greer to buy four more.",Marshall
9032,Really?,Lily
9033,"Mm-hmm, at $500 a piece.",Marshall
9034,That's two grand. That's more than we need for the contractor.,Lily
9035,"Yeah, but I was actually thinking we could reinvest it.",Marshall
9036,In what?,Lily
9037,In you.,Marshall
9038,"Well, it's not exactly the clientele I had in mind, but... thank you for believing in me.",Lily
9039,"Man, birds do not get you.",Marshall
9040,"Hey, I think I left my tie here. Have you seen it?",Barney
9041,"Yeah, that was a bit. We were doing a bit.",Barney
9042,"Abby, I've... I've got some bad news. I can't marry you.",Barney
9043,Ted begged me not to. I think he's in love with you.,Barney
9044,"Yes, our plan worked better than we ever dreamed. You have to go to him. Here's his home address. But you know what? He works late, so I wouldn't go before 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.",Barney
9045,"Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that. That's made of candy. Later.",Barney
9046,"Hey, go to lilyandmarshallselltheirstuff.com or charityfolks.com.",Marshall
9047,We're having an auction to rise money for the children's hospital of Los Angeles,Lily
9048,You could get tons of cool stuff on the sell and they all use for great cause.,Marshall
9049,"Goliath National Bank. The world leader in credit and banking. God, I love Goliath National Bank!",Barney
9050,"Okay, first of all, you look like the last pick in the draft. And, second, why are you so excited about some bank?",Ted
9051,"Our company just bought them out in a ruthless takeover. Took two months. Cost 2,000 jobs. It was brutal. Who wants a T-shirt? (He throws one to Ted.) Hey, Marshall, they're hiring in the legal department. I could get you a job.",Barney
9052,"Barney, Marshall didn't quit his last soul-sucking corporate job just to go work at a bank. He's gonna be an environmental lawyer.",Lily
9053,"So, what do you guys want to do for dinner?",Ted
9054,"Great, we'll take five of those.",Robin
9055,Really? You want to eat here?,Ted
9056,"Yeah, I'm freaking starving. I just finished a seven-day cleanse.",Robin
9057,I thought you started that yesterday.,Marshall
9058,"I finished early, OK? <em>(To Wendy)</em> Five of those.",Robin
9059,Wait. What about sushi?,Ted
9060,We had sushi last night.,Lily
9061,Italian.,Barney
9062,I had Italian for lunch.,Ted
9063,"No. We always do this. We spend an hour arguing about where to eat, and we end up here anyway. I haven't eaten for two days. Can we please, for the love of God, just order something now?",Robin
9064,Chinese?,Ted
9065,Oh.,Robin
9066,I don't like Chinese.,Barney
9067,Indian?,Ted
9068,I just said I don't like Chinese.,Barney
9069,Indian isn't Chinese.,Ted
9070,"Weird meats, funny music, side of rice. Why are we splitting hairs?",Barney
9071,Mexican?,Ted
9072,I just said I don't like Chinese.,Barney
9073,God.,Robin
9074,"Of course, mine comes last. Go ahead, start without me.",Robin
9075,"My God. This burger is so good. It's like Christmas in my mouth, meat Christmas.",Lily
9076,It's like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's. Where the chef k*ll it and ran it through the meat grinder.,Ted
9077,"I love this burger so much, I want to sew my ass shut.",Barney
9078,It's okay.,Marshall
9079,"Guys, guys, guys. When you've had the best burger in NY, every other burger tastes like my grandpa's feet. But you guys eat up, enjoy my grandpa's feet.",Marshall
9080,And you've had the best burger in New York?,Robin
9081,"It was eight years ago, my first week in New York, and for a kid from Minnesota, the big city was a scary place.",Marshall
9082,"Oh, thank God it's just you.",Marshall
9083,"You are being ridiculous. (<em>Taking the bat.)</em> Tell me, you left the apartment today?",Ted
9084,"Why would I have to leave? I can have anything I want delivered, and New York City cable is awesome. Have you seen this public access show with the old Jewish lady in a bikini? <em>(Laughing)</em> It's disgusting.",Marshall
9085,"Marshall, you have to get over this paranoia. You are not gonna get mugged.",Ted
9086,"What if I do, Ted. I don't have a switchblade. I don't know how to break-dance and win the begrudging respect of a street gang.",Marshall
9087,"That's it, you're taking a walk. Come on, go.",Ted
9088,"No. Look, the old lady in a bikini is back on. I'm just gonna lie back and get comfortable.",Marshall
9089,"Go outside, go, go.",Ted
9090,Okay. <em>(He takes the bat discreetly.)</em>,Marshall
9091,Leave the bat.,Ted
9092,Fine.,Marshall
9093,"And then, right when I started to get a little hungry, I turned a corner...",Marshall
9094,And there it was.,Marshall
9095,Name two places where things get stuffed.,Barney
9096,"So, I went inside.",Marshall
9097,"Ted, you got to wake up. Wake...",Marshall
9098,"Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Are you okay?",Ted
9099,"I'm all right. Ted, I've just had the most amazing burger of my life! It's this awesome little place, Regis Philbin eats there, so it's sort of like a celebrity hot spot. But the burger. The burger. Dude.",Marshall
9100,I want one of those burgers right now! Do you think they're still open?,Ted
9101,I don't know<em>. (Looking to his watch.)</em> Does stuff in New York stay open past... 9:30?,Marshall
9102,You couldn't find it?,Robin
9103,We didn't know our way around. Just getting back to the apartment took us three hours and one very helpful drag queen.,Ted
9104,"Wait, Penny Noir was a drag queen?",Marshall
9105,Where do you think it was?,Robin
9106,Probably tucked between her legs.,Lily
9107,You know what's not a drag? Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying.,Barney
9108,"Anyways, we never found the place. Now, eight years have passed, still... No burger.",Marshall
9109,"Okay, here we go.",Marshall
9110,"No, you don't.",Marshall
9111,"Oh, the Corner Bistro! It's amazing, I spent a quarter of my life searching for the best burger in New York City, but silly me, it never occurred to me to check the highest-rated burger in the Zagat guide. Wow, thanks a lot, guy. Let me return the favor. Great cup of coffee: Starbucks.",Marshall
9112,So I take it you've tried the Corner Bistro.,Robin
9113,"Robin, I've tried every so-called best burger in New York City trying to find that burger. Or at least forget about her.",Marshall
9114,But none of those places even came close.,Marshall
9115,"There was that one time we thought we had a break in the case, remember?",Ted
9116,Get this. You know who works out at my gym? Regis Philbin.,Barney
9117,"That's the one, Mr. Philbin. Do you remember where it is?",Marshall
9118,No.,Marshall
9119,"No. No, we don't know where it is.",Barney
9120,"I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!",Barney
9121,"OK, Regis, we will, we will.",Barney
9122,All right.,Barney
9123,That's where my story ends. Now I'm doomed to walk the earth forever searching for that green door and that red neon sign that says &quot;Burger.&quot;,Marshall
9124,"Green door, red neon sign that says &quot;Burger?&quot;",Robin
9125,Yeah.,Marshall
9126,"I know that place. I've walked by it a million times. It's on West 12th, right off of 7th.",Robin
9127,I knew it was on a numbered street!,Marshall
9128,Finally.,Robin
9129,No...,Robin
9130,I cannot believe we're finally gonna have this burger,Marshall
9131,"Honey, I'm so excited for you. After all these interviews, after all these disappointments, you deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat.",Lily
9132,"You know what else is a mouthful? All that double-talk other banks give you. At Goliath, customer satisfaction is our most important investment.",Barney
9133,"Barney, I hate to break this to you, but working for a bank's kind of lame.",Lily
9134,"How lame is free a*t*matic bill pay? How lame is 3.3% APY online savings? Yeah, that's right. Hate to make you look stupid in front of your friends, but you left me no choice. <em>He laughs.</em>",Barney
9135,We should probably call Regis.,Ted
9136,Reg... <em>(He takes his phone.)</em> That guy scares me. I think I'll leave him a text.,Barney
9137,"Green door, red neon sign. Guys, this is the place. I've actually, I prepared a few words.",Marshall
9138,Let's just go inside then. Shall we?,Marshall
9139,"Please, go ahead, start.",Robin
9140,Just shut up and eat.,Robin
9141,All right.,Barney
9142,Oh my god. I'm never brushing my teeth again unless it's with a toothbrush made from this burger.,Ted
9143,I think I just had my first burg-asm.,Lily
9144,"I want... to take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie, then take it back to my place, put on a little Terence Trent D'arby, and then I would just... fool around a little bit. Nothing serious, just take it slow, you know?",Barney
9145,It's not it.,Marshall
9146,"Marshall, you might not want to hear this, but... is it at all possible this is the same",Ted
9147,"I mean, it is just a burger.",Robin
9148,"Just a burger? It's so much more than just a burger. I mean, that first bite... Oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like a sesame-freckled breast of an angel, resting gently on the ketchup and mustard below. Flavors mingling in a seductive &quot;pas de deux&quot;. And then... a pickle the most... playful... little pickle, and then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce, and a... a patty... of ground beef, so... exquisite...swirling in your mouth, breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savories so... delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread. This is God... speaking to us through food.",Marshall
9149,And you got our wedding vows off the Internet.,Lily
9150,"Okay, look, so, so this, this isn't the place. All right, it's no big deal. It's another place with a green door and a red neon sign that says &quot;Burger&quot;. I'll just... I'll call every restaurant in Manhattan and ask 'em what colour their door is. No big deal, right? Let's do this.",Marshall
9151,I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this isn't just about a burger.,Robin
9152,"Marshall's not doing so well, guys. He really needs to get a job.",Lily
9153,Tell them about the underpants.,Ted
9154,What about the underpants?,Robin
9155,It started a couple of weeks ago.,Lily
9156,Heads! It's going to be heads. It's almost usually heads.,Marshall
9157,"Hey, baby.",Lily
9158,Hey!,Marshall
9159,Did you put on pants today?,Lily
9160,Nope. <em>They laugh.</em>,Marshall
9161,"It was funny at first, but then it became a daily thing. I thought, &quot;Okay, well, at least he's not leaving the house like that.&quot; Then, one day, he opened the door to get the paper. Day after that, went downstairs to get the mail.",Lily
9162,"Everyone's got an underpants radius. For most of us, it's the distance from the bedroom to the bathroom, but as your self-esteem gets smaller, your underpants radius gets bigger.",Ted
9163,How big is Marshall's underpants radius?,Robin
9164,We're going.,Marshall
9165,"Come on, Lily, he'll find a job eventually.",Ted
9166,"You know, Lil, when times are tough, I like to remember the uplifting words of my favourite song. <em>He starts singing.</em> &quot;<em>We'll be on your side when you need a friend. Through thick and thin you can always depend. On the world leaders in credit and banking. Goliath National Bank.&quot;</em> Member FDIC.",Barney
9167,We've got to find Marshall that burger.,Lily
9168,"Lily, I think we're all eating that burger.",Ted
9169,I'm not eating that burger.,Robin
9170,"No, if Marshall says this isn't the burger, this isn't it.",Lily
9171,Finally.,Robin
9172,"Excuse me. Did you guys change cooks or something? Because my husband was here 5 years ago, he's sure he had a different burger. <em>Robin is trying to take the plate.</em>",Lily
9173,What? Uptown? Where?,Ted
9174,Damn it.,Robin
9175,106. A numbered street. Of course.,Marshall
9176,Barney Stinson.,Barney
9177,"I'm sorry, this is...?",Barney
9178,"Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now.",Barney
9179,Onions?,Barney
9180,"Okay, no onions.",Barney
9181,Stop the cab!,Marshall
9182,Wait. This is it.,Marshall
9183,This is it.,Marshall
9184,"One of 9,000 convenient locations.",Barney
9185,It was ri... it was right here. It was... it was right on this very spot.,Marshall
9186,I don't understand. Where is the burger place?,Robin
9187,It's not a burger place anymore; it's a Goliath National Bank ATM.,Ted
9188,We can't eat here. It's an ATM.,Ted
9189,But... food.,Robin
9190,What the...,Barney
9191,"This is your fault, you and your stupid bank. You did this.",Lily
9192,"It's not my... Stop, okay. <em>She hits his knee</em>. Stop that, Lily.",Barney
9193,"I will never use a Goliath ATM ever again. Goliath National Bank sucks. It's the worst bank on the face of the earth. Attention, New Yorkers, this bank sucks! They suck!",Lily
9194,"Marshall, Geez.",Barney
9195,"They suck, suck!",Lily
9196,Will you just tell her already?,Barney
9197,Tell me what? Tell me what?,Lily
9198,I got a job.,Marshall
9199,What? Where?,Lily
9200,"Goliath National Bank. That's why Barney's been going on and on about how, how great Goliath is. He wanted you to be excited for me since we will to working together.",Marshall
9201,"Well, technically not together. You won't have access to my floor.",Barney
9202,But you want to be an environmental lawyer.,Lily
9203,"Yeah and I also want to be a Harlem Globetrotter and get paid in candy, but in the meantime, I need a job, and this is, this is a really good one. It's great pay and there's good benefits, and to be honest, it gives me a reason to put on pants in the morning. You know, I have my whole life to save the planet, but right now I'm kind of really excited to wear pants again.",Marshall
9204,You've got great pants.,Lily
9205,I love you.,Marshall
9206,I love you.,Lily
9207,"Robin, no!",Ted
9208,They're unopened.,Robin
9209,Give it.,Ted
9210,They're barbecue.,Robin
9211,Give it!,Ted
9212,I'm sorry you didn't get your burger.,Lily
9213,"It's stupid. I think about that first week in New York. You know? I was 22 years old. I had my whole future ahead of me. I guess I just kind of thought that if I could have that burger one more time and feel that way for one more night, that I might be able to check that off the list, and grow up, go work for the stupid bank, and just... be happy.",Marshall
9214,Let's pay the man.,Marshall
9215,I paid for the cab.,Lily
9216,I have any cash.,Ted
9217,I haven't worked since March.,Marshall
9218,"If only there were an easy, convenient way to get some cash right now.",Barney
9219,Member FDIC.,Barney
9220,Thank you.,Marshall
9221,"All right, Marshall, remember. It might not taste as good. This place has changed, you've changed, New York has changed. Just... don't get your hopes up too high, okay?",Ted
9222,This is it.,Marshall
9223,"It's exactly the same. It's the best burger in New York. Go ahead, eat up, eat up.",Marshall
9224,"I want to get tiny fitted sheets for this burger, and just... crawl into this bun, get all cosy, and die there.",Lily
9225,"Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me.",Robin
9226,This feels so good. I'm worried I'm gonna get this burger pregnant.,Barney
9227,"If he does get that burger pregnant, I have dibs on the delicious burger babies.",Marshall
9228,That's outrageous.,Barney
9229,You were just freakin' teasing us.,Marshall
9230,"Well, I must go to Stella. Tonight is the big night. I tried before, I always failed. This time I will succeed. Tonight... I am a lesbian. Robin, your lipstick.",Barney
9231,"Oh, no! Take pictures, okay?",Ted
9232,"Hi, Ted.",Barney
9233,"Oh, no!",Ted
9234,"Hi, Matisse.",Ted
9235,Theodore!,Marshall
9236,T-Diddy! You've missed that!,Barney
9237,Robin has had the job of presenter.,Lily
9238,And we have a free bottle of champagne.,Robin
9239,But it's empty now.,Marshall
9240,"Oh, no!",Ted
9241,"Oh, no!",Ted
9242,"What's up, G?",Ted
9243,"Yeah, okay. It's just that... You know, I want to spend time with you, with my friends. I seem to spend my life on the train.",Ted
9244,It's a great idea.,Ted
9245,"You want us to go in New Jersey? Oh, that's great.",Marshall
9246,Why?,Ted
9247,"First, I no longer have my gold medallions. I sold them when they are out of date, 400 years ago.",Barney
9248,Lily?,Ted
9249,"I'm sorry, Ted. I am a New Yorker pure juice. I am programmed to despise and hate New Jersey and all it represents. Why I say that? You hate him more than anyone.",Lily
9250,What? I love New Jersey. Why you say that?,Ted
9251,"And then he walks past me. I hate you not respect the queue more than New Jersey. In fact, this is false. There's nothing I hate more than New Jersey.",Ted
9252,"Great, huh?",Ted
9253,It's waiting for you?,Marshall
9254,"No, it'll take a while. I have to drop a massive New Jersey.",Ted
9255,"So New Jersey is not my favorite place. But when we get married, and they have moved in with me, I will never stay there. Unless I see the Giants and I evacuated New York or I get rid of a body.",Ted
9256,"Ted, if you m*rder me and bury me in New Jersey, I'll haunt thee for ever.",Lily
9257,And if I assassinate and bury you somewhere else?,Ted
9258,I'll leave you alone. I'm sure you had your reasons.,Lily
9259,"I am Robin Scherbatsky, and you look... (The Metro M falls) Etro New One to 23h. (Thus the one from 11 pm) And again at 1am.",Robin
9260,So hurry up and vote for the cutest dog in New York.,Robin
9261,"Four workers were electrocuted when a subway train derailed. Stay here for more... de-rail shocking. Joel, people died.",Robin
9262,"Tonight is my last issue. I arrived in Metro New One as a small caterpillar. And for 4 years, this office was my cocoon.But tonight, I turned into a butterfly ambitious.",Robin
9263,Why it looks silly? She had a stroke?,Marshall
9264,"Yeah, a stroke of genius. This speech is really good.",Ted
9265,"With an eye on the horizon, a look at the truth, and an eye on you all.",Robin
9266,"It's you who wrote, right?",Lily
9267,This is a modified version of one I did when I left the swim team because of an ear problem.,Ted
9268,You wore towels.,Marshall
9269,It's part of the team.,Ted
9270,"Stella has not found a babysitter, you're stuck. Instead, we'll all stay here and it'll be awesome.",Ted
9271,"It's pathetic. It's Saturday night. We should get drunk in a bar. I know this sounds depressing, almost tragic, but it is a fact.",Marshall
9272,"Yeah, and I want another drink for this girl, Doris. I know I can ask this aircraft lesbian.",Barney
9273,No snakes on that plane.,Marshall
9274,"Come on guys, you promised. We stay there and we try to have fun. We're all here. Being with friends. It's not that the primary?",Ted
9275,"With the next train, you can be in McClaren's to 23h.",Lily
9276,You can be at 22h.,Barney
9277,"No, I have to change. I'm not feeling in New Jersey.",Lily
9278,What? No!,Marshall
9279,"Yeah, probably.",Lily
9280,That's great! We have darts. A half ping-pong. An aquarium. Look how it's getting a great night as planned. One could make the bait and watch them fight.,Ted
9281,No thank you. I play not with aquariums unless they are my two favorite animals: the pilot fish and torturlute. Did you see!,Barney
9282,For torturlute? You're right.,Ted
9283,Marshall.,Barney
9284,You deserve better than that.,Marshall
9285,Lily.,Barney
9286,Not good enough.,Lily
9287,Stella.,Barney
9288,"I fall not rest until we not make me respect for another person's knuckles brushing against mine so sweet, but manly.Small, small... Small, small... Small... Who's the baby? Know that as long as it does not have what he wants. No, deserves.This fist will not waver. It... bow... not.",Barney
9289,"Yes, why not.",Lily
9290,When I what?,Ted
9291,I thought they came to live with you.,Lily
9292,"Me too. My God, I moved to New Jersey?",Ted
9293,"Guys, I'm sure the dog had to soaring after swallowing the tablet X. Too good! Go!",Barney
9294,I can not live here.,Ted
9295,"It's not so bad. You can put a mini fridge, there, and perhaps an air hockey.",Marshall
9296,Air Hockey. Well done my fat.,Barney
9297,"I speak of New Jersey in general, not the basement. She wants me moved? I do not get it. It was discussed there for months.",Ted
9298,"I thought that after marriage, Lucy and you could sit here.",Ted
9299,I understand why they want to live in New Jersey when you can live in Manhattan? I thought my apartment was one of his reasons for marrying me.,Ted
9300,"Seriously, I thought it was the only one. Too much!(Robin arrives in the basement) You're glowing. Tape the Barnacle.",Barney
9301,Stella has already warned me.,Robin
9302,"So, your first day?",Marshall
9303,It was not.,Robin
9304,"It was not my first day. I arrived and there were 20 people. In fact, I have not really got the job. I just had an interview.",Robin
9305,How so?,Barney
9306,I know. He told me that I had had it.,Robin
9307,I got it? I got it!,Robin
9308,Thank you! Thank you!,Robin
9309,I'll call and beg Joel for giving me my job.,Robin
9310,No!,Marshall
9311,You hate that job.,Lily
9312,It was not so bad.,Robin
9313,How they made you call the Hurricane Hector when he was pouring with rain?,Lily
9314,A cycorde.,Robin
9315,You're in the eye of cycorde.,Marshall
9316,Thank you.,Ted
9317,Naughty.,Barney
9318,"That sucks, but I can do what? I will not have another job. You would have seen other women in the interview. They were all more experienced, more &quot;ethnic&quot;. There was a black girl with blue eyes. How can I compete?",Robin
9319,You can not.,Barney
9320,"You can compete with anyone. You're Robin Scherbatsky. Confident, strong, great. With super long legs that look great in shorts.",Lily
9321,I called Joel.,Robin
9322,"If you call now, you'll regret it. I slept with me full of women who were then sent to graze and then decamped. And sometimes they take the phone and they call me and do it again. And when we finished, I see that look on their faces, that look that says they hate themselves and they would never have known. But if you could see this look... In fact, you can see that look, there is a video, http://www...",Barney
9323,Come on. I will not call.,Robin
9324,This is the look.,Barney
9325,I can not live here. I hate being here. I would k*ll myself.,Ted
9326,"New Jersey is not so bad. Stella has a lawn. You can have a lawn mower. They sell there. I've seen with a cup holder. I saw a deck chair with a cup holder. I even saw a hammock with a cup holder. You live in New Jersey, you will not have to hold a cup.",Marshall
9327,"It asks me no problem holding a cup, unlike you.",Ted
9328,I'll give you $ 100 for hitting my fist. $ 200.,Barney
9329,"Drop it, Barney. Your arm should make you suffer.",Lily
9330,$ 10 000.,Barney
9331,You'll be on the other side of the river. You'll be in New York all the time.,Marshall
9332,I'm sorry. You are in New York?,Ted
9333,Are you in town?,Ted
9334,You see? All the time.,Marshall
9335,When was the last time?,Ted
9336,It's been closed for six years.,Ted
9337,I can not do that. I'll tell Stella she and Lucy are coming to town and that's it.,Ted
9338,"What do you think guys? Beagle, or Boston terrier?",Marshall
9339,It's the tears?,Lily
9340,They are magnificent... manly tears of pain. They are not emotional. They are a little emotional.,Barney
9341,Where is Robin?,Lily
9342,"Shirley, this is Robin. I called Joel.",Robin
9343,"Robin, hangs up. Do not do that.",Barney
9344,"Sorry, I know, OK?",Robin
9345,If you hang up no...,Lily
9346,"Stop! Joel, this is Robin.",Robin
9347,I'm sorry for saying all this stuff.,Robin
9348,"Ok, I have half an hour to arrive at the studio.",Robin
9349,You can never be in town in 30 minutes.,Lily
9350,"Do not do it. It's scary to bet on itself, if you do not, nobody will. I'm not saying that to pat my fist. Even if a punch would be great. I mean it.",Barney
9351,I bet on me. I bet I can be there for 23h.,Robin
9352,"Yeah, I took a pack of 144. The rest is in the trunk.",Ted
9353,No.,Ted
9354,"Was in line for the pictures, my hair is in the air... I want to live in New Jersey.",Ted
9355,I can not. And I see no reason that you did not come to New York.,Ted
9356,"Yes, but my apartment is close to the Metro.",Ted
9357,How does it &quot;end of discussion&quot;? It never was.,Ted
9358,People with kids are moving all the time. It would be great for Lucy to grow up in the largest city in the world.,Ted
9359,Better than...? You think...? I... The Empire State Buil...H and H Bage... The center Linco... Zabar's... Papaya King.New York is the cultural and intellectual center of the planet.,Ted
9360,"Hey, I know my neighbors!",Ted
9361,"At the other end of the hall, there is... Clax... pa... I.",Ted
9362,It is called Paxton.,Lily
9363,I love this guy.,Ted
9364,"Sorry, I'm in a hurry. I go to before I go down first.",Robin
9365,"Ok, this is crazy. You can not believe that New Jersey is better than New York. In New York, there was Broadway. No need to say more.",Lily
9366,"Oh, yes. Tape for safety.",Barney
9367,You can not b*at A.C. Pity! Nobody needs to know.,Barney
9368,New York has Greenwich Village.,Ted
9369,Chronicles of the Oscar-winning on urban neurotic.Tape!,Barney
9370,Sinatra.,Ted
9371,"But that city he sings? This is not &quot;Secaucus, Secaucus.&quot;",Ted
9372,"Look, Stella, I understand that coming from New Jersey, you think not to like New York, but believe me, Marshall did not believe it either, and now he would move for anything.",Lily
9373,"I hate New York! Sorry, but it's true. Today, I passed PriceCo. You've already been? It's huge. The New York stores are cramped. When I turn, I spill something. I'm like a big monster out of the ocean to destroy bodegas.",Marshall
9374,"but, Marshall, you love New York.",Lily
9375,"Yes, except I hate it. I'm too big for New York! I try to hold seats in the cramped subway or stoop under doors over 150 years. People are taller, have larger doors. What is your problem?",Marshall
9376,"Small town, big men, then tope.",Barney
9377,"It is too noisy, all the time. Yes, it is the city that never sleeps. Well, I would sleep well. I'm tired for 8 years. Tired and scared, with black and blue marks on my elbows to try to keep between the gateway for elves. New Jersey's great. There are department stores, and lawn and you do not have to wear a cup. For the rest of your life. I'm not afraid to say so. I love New Jersey. Just kidding.",Marshall
9378,"I understand, OK? I see what you mean. I guess... we could live in Brooklyn.",Ted
9379,Silence embarrassed. Tope then.,Barney
9380,"Hey, Lucy. What are you doing up?",Ted
9381,Sorry. Go back to sleep.,Ted
9382,"Ok, I'll get your mom...",Ted
9383,Let's go.,Ted
9384,I moved here.,Ted
9385,Really. New Jersey wins.,Ted
9386,"Oh, thank you! Wait. Good evening, New York.",Robin
9387,"Look, it did.",Barney
9388,"Our story tonight, the baby panda at the zoo in Central Park made his first tooth today. I think that makes him a... Bear molar. Bear molar. Bear molar. You know what? It's really over for me. Good night, New York.",Robin
9389,It really stops.,Lily
9390,You think you're there for something?,Barney
9391,"I think so. Good job, Barney.",Lily
9392,"Oh, my God! Thank you! Oh, I k*ll my arm. My arm has never been so sore since I was 13 the day I knew how to close the bathroom. Cool!",Barney
9393,What's the matter?,Lily
9394,I have not officially got the job.,Robin
9395,I'm sorry.,Lily
9396,It's OK. They offer me another.,Robin
9397,It's great. This is for what?,Ted
9398,Foreign Correspondent. I... moved to Japan.,Robin
9399,Barney's crazy if he thinks it'll work.,Robin
9400,I think it'll work.,Marshall
9401,I hope not.,Lily
9402,There he is.,Ted
9403,What are you doing?,Ted
9404,"In a few minutes, the young me your time will enter through this door. I know it sounds crazy, but to save the planet, you have to sleep with him tonight.",Barney
9405,"Well, the movers arrive in 14 hours. We have to go back to finish the boxes.",Lily
9406,You have not finished? Why is it so long?,Robin
9407,The best memories of our 20 years were held in it. It's not that throw stuff in a box. You look back at the past.,Ted
9408,Not me. The key? Discard tips and not looking back. I go to Japan. It took me half an hour.,Robin
9409,A half hour?,Lily
9410,"I could take 20 minutes, but a friend called me in tears.",Robin
9411,Moving is very moving.,Marshall
9412,"But it is. Finally, everything changes. I will live with Stella, you will be in your new apartment. You start a new job in Tokyo. This is the end of an era. We should make a toast, but not with the usual shit. Your bottle of Scotch the most expensive.",Ted
9413,"Excellent. A bottle of beer with it, and what do you think will cancel the Scotch?",Ted
9414,Vive la vodka.,Barney
9415,It will not work.,Robin
9416,"I guess I have time for a drink and 45 minutes to an hour for other activities, but after that, I must return to the top secret research project I'm working on.",Barney
9417,My God! How do you know that?,Barney
9418,Look at this. A photo of the day we moved. So many good memories.,Ted
9419,"Well, that's exactly the kind of crap to throw away.",Robin
9420,So you keep a photograph?,Ted
9421,"It's like love letters, directories or the ashes of people.They take up space. In addition, she will let you not keep half your mess.",Robin
9422,Why not?,Ted
9423,"Oh, dear. That's what the guys know that after moving in with a woman. All your stuff are idiots.",Lily
9424,Like what?,Ted
9425,Like everything else you bought the medieval festivals.,Lily
9426,There is not enough drinks in the world that I drop my scourge.,Ted
9427,"As you will not get bail, I thought you could pay me half.",Marshall
9428,"Wait, why I pay more?",Ted
9429,Because you've treated this apart as John Bonham treated his nervous system.,Marshall
9430,That's not true.,Ted
9431,Proof A.,Marshall
9432,What is it?,Marshall
9433,An Encyclopedia &quot;World Book&quot; of 1986. It is with these that I grew up.,Ted
9434,Encyclopedia?,Marshall
9435,"Do you think we should say-die encyclo-pil. It's a common mistake. But if you look at the direction of the bar on the &quot;e&quot;. The symbol of this encyclopedia, you'll know it is a diacritic which aims to change...",Ted
9436,"You know, it'll have you &quot;dia-pays&quot; for it.",Marshall
9437,"But you've ever done. Second, the evidence B.",Marshall
9438,"Hello, good topics. Look what I won at the festival.",Ted
9439,You're also responsible for damage to Robin when she was your girlfriend.,Marshall
9440,What damage did I do?,Robin
9441,Do you remember the time you got drunk the pack of beer and you've become Super Canadian?,Marshall
9442,Stanley Cup game six? The Rangers will regret having met with the Canucks.,Robin
9443,$ 20 if you manage to run it through the door.,Marshall
9444,You're more amazing than a Tim Hortons donut. Timmy Ho!,Robin
9445,"I'll give you the teeth of happiness. A little here, a little there.",Robin
9446,Give me the stick.,Lily
9447,"Get out, bouseuse.",Robin
9448,Let's go!,Lily
9449,"Catch it, guys!",Ted
9450,I'll break!,Robin
9451,"Girls, stop!",Ted
9452,For America.,Marshall
9453,It's good enough!,Ted
9454,It does not stop a fight between girls! Ever!,Barney
9455,"Barney's fault entirely. As fat burning on the mantelpiece, for that matter.",Ted
9456,This is the man of the evening. It's time to let the monster out of his cage!,Barney
9457,"Come on, man. People want to see Bruce Banner.They want Hulk. What?",Barney
9458,I'm really proud that we have helped Stewart.,Robin
9459,"Yes, what a moment of incredible human sincerity.",Lily
9460,It's true. We live.,Marshall
9461,You're going to seriously continue to wear this hat?,Barney
9462,"Yes, it's been two weeks.",Lily
9463,"Two wonderful weeks... and oh yes, I will continue to wear it.",Marshall
9464,This is an intervention.,Lily
9465,About the hat.,Ted
9466,I control. I can remove it whenever I want.,Marshall
9467,"&quot;Dear Marshall, I do not like that stupid hat. I want to cut with a scythe. Or, cut the chisel, for you looks like a real jerk. &quot;",Robin
9468,Oh my God. This is one of p'tain of pleasant surprise. This is about what?,Lily
9469,This is about the exaggerated English accent.,Ted
9470,P'tain.,Lily
9471,"Self Tanner? They entice you with a coupon, and after it becomes addictive.",Robin
9472,"We know, darling, you know. This is a brand new vest.",Lily
9473,What?,Barney
9474,The magic tricks.,Robin
9475,"Specifically, those with fire.",Lily
9476,"The magic tricks? Guys, interventions are meant to help people, not to address every aspect you do not like.Sorry, but it warms me. It makes me boil! I mean, I am filled with a burning rage! (There is a magic trick, but set fire to the banner) Thanks! Oh, shit.",Barney
9477,It smells like hair!,Lily
9478,"It's weird. By removing the closet, I thought I saw the banner.",Ted
9479,And?,Marshall
9480,"And the flag was b*rned. Why new? And there are letters from you all, with &quot;Ted&quot; written on it. You prepare a response for me?",Ted
9481,"Well, that was stupid. Yes, forget it.",Lily
9482,That was why? The sandals? Hair products?,Ted
9483,No Stella.,Marshall
9484,"My God, it was for Stella.",Ted
9485,I just said &quot;No Stella.&quot; It was perhaps for your hearing problems.,Marshall
9486,What?,Ted
9487,It's getting serious. You see?,Marshall
9488,You think I should not marry Stella. You think I should not marry.,Ted
9489,We want him. We are all really happy for you.,Marshall
9490,"Like I said, it was stupid.",Lily
9491,"Obviously, it was not, it had agreed to make interventions more stupid to work on interventions.",Ted
9492,We made too many interventions.,Ted
9493,What was your biggest problem with me and Stella?,Ted
9494,Stella.,Ted
9495,&quot;I can not remain indifferent... &quot;,Barney
9496,You kept it on you?,Ted
9497,"Please. &quot;I can not remain impassive while you make the biggest mistake a man can do... get married. Keep my words, it will all part... &quot;Flames! Oh, shit! I sent the flame too soon. I had so many important things to say, and... The fact is, Ted, marriage is stupid. Each year there are a million girls aged 22, sexy, who go to bars and call me, &quot;glass half full&quot;, but I think they become beasts.",Barney
9498,"Even you, you will meet more girls in 22 years when you get 80.",Marshall
9499,I meet this challenge.,Barney
9500,What challenge?,Marshall
9501,Prove that I will be just as great at 80. I'll go out with a girl of 22 years with my old man makeup.,Barney
9502,"I did not challenge. I would love to see it, but I've not challenged.",Marshall
9503,I want to hear the other letters.,Ted
9504,This is ridiculous. It changed his mind.,Lily
9505,"And if you changed yet? Go Lily, listen to yours.",Ted
9506,&quot;The capabilities of Gilbert reading have improved considerably... &quot;This is a letter I had to give one of my students.,Lily
9507,I can hear yours?,Ted
9508,"&quot;Dear Ted, it's encyclo-pe-die, not encyclo-pil-die. Why you always want to say things so pretentious? Looks like a moron, and it's cr-e-tin and non-cr-ay-tin. &quot;",Robin
9509,You've already read the intervention on my pronunciation. Where is the letter of Stella?,Ted
9510,"I have not written. I am your ex. I told myself that everything I say is offensive. In addition, I am sexier it, so who cares?",Robin
9511,Water has flowed under the bridge...,Marshall
9512,Come on.,Ted
9513,"&quot;Dear Ted, Stella seems to be wonderful. But you do not know enough to get married. You do not know probably not enough to get involved in raising a child with her. You do not restore her service or her child or yourself by throwing yourself like that. Just take a little longer. &quot; It was there for months, OK?That was before we know Stella and that way as she's great and what you train super torque. That's why we decided to not make this statement.",Marshall
9514,Thank you. Because I really need you to handle it.,Ted
9515,And we're here.,Marshall
9516,And we hope you're not sorry.,Robin
9517,Of course not. It's not like what you said was nonsense.You you were worried.,Ted
9518,But concerns that a completely expelled.,Lily
9519,But you score a point. It all happened very quickly.,Ted
9520,"You know what? This may be because... when it's good, you know.",Marshall
9521,"I guess, but we are still at the stage where one seeks to know himself. And Lily, you may be right. Stella will not like my stuff. As the robot pot cake. This is the first thing we bought here, remember?",Ted
9522,Of course it does. My sensors indicate that your shortbread levels are dangerously low.,Marshall
9523,"My collection of James Bond. You know, we looked at them in order, and... Lily spoke with this weird English accent, until the next month?",Ted
9524,It was sophisticated.,Lily
9525,My cleats signed by Bernie Kosar. My lamp elephant.The English phone booth. My sombrero!,Ted
9526,What are you doing?,Robin
9527,I unpack. I never leave this apartment.,Ted
9528,"Ted, stop unpacking. You're in the process of pinball.",Lily
9529,"I'm not ready for this responsibility, let alone to be the stepfather of a 7 year old daughter. If I get married and moved to the suburbs, in a twinkling, I exchange old!",Ted
9530,83 years. How old are you?,Barney
9531,Ted going bonkers. The movers arrive in 10 hours. His bride awaits in New Jersey. We must do something.,Lily
9532,"I'm on it. Hey, man?",Marshall
9533,Hey.,Ted
9534,Come here a minute.,Marshall
9535,What?,Ted
9536,"Know that this is quite normal. The major change can be frightening, and fear... it is one of them. So... why not you give me the kn*fe? Give it to me. Go. That way I can unpack too. I will stay with you forever! We had a nice life here.That's why we rejected the package. Because unconsciously, we all know that it would be stupid to leave. It's safe and warm here. There is a downstairs bar, a robot cookie in the kitchen.This is my house and I never leave!",Marshall
9537,"Listen up! You sound like that big beta colo. &quot;Mom, Dad, I want to go. Cool boys play hide and seek with my inhaler. &quot;",Robin
9538,I can not believe my father had read this letter at our wedding.,Marshall
9539,"You can not do that to Lily. Your new apartment a few problems with the floor not right and the sewage treatment plant next door, but you will make a great home. Tell her, Lily.",Robin
9540,"This is the black hole where dreams go to die. I move it, either.",Lily
9541,Come on.,Robin
9542,"Guys, finish unpacking. I will bake cookies to fill R2-plump.",Lily
9543,"My God, what a band of cowards! Frightened by the slightest change. Terrified by all that is new. Desperate to cling to your comfort zone. I can not go to Japan. What was I thinking? It's so far. I speak the language. I have not even good pictures of you.",Robin
9544,"Oh, honey.",Lily
9545,"Everybody says it's good to change, right? But it's what's good?",Marshall
9546,"Who wants to go to the same old bar, sit at the same place and drink the same thing? The same thing! My favorite!",Ted
9547,"Oh, my God!",Ted
9548,I think someone owes me $ 200.,Barney
9549,"Barney, it was not a gamble. Person...",Marshall
9550,I am moving to New Jersey.,Ted
9551,What?,Lily
9552,"And you should move into the new apartment, and Robin should go to Japan.",Ted
9553,Why?,Robin
9554,"Because it will age like it or not, then the real question is: do we want to go forward or clinging desperately to the past and end up like that?",Ted
9555,"Okay, it matters not.",Marshall
9556,"It is French, it's like playing tennis without a net.",Robin
9557,"You know what? I take care of the warranty. It makes me happy, because every hole in this apartment is a memory I will never forget. But on one condition: you put all 10 tickets aside every week for next year and come back here and buy this tape 50 years of age, and a toast to the incredible year full of change that we had it. Remove from us. My new family and I, Marshall and Lily, in their apartment and Robin in a number of English-language journalists in the West Pacific, ending up here in New York to celebrate this day... The day we closed one chapter of our lives incredibly, to open a new one.",Ted
9558,Remove from here.,Ted
9559,"So, let's raise our glasses of scotch at $ 2 500 for a year of hell.",Ted
9560,Amazing.,Robin
9561,It's amazing.,Barney
9562,"It's smoky, with hints of cedar and old... You see the difference between that and tape for $ 10?",Ted
9563,Not at all.,Marshall
9564,I would much Red Bull.,Barney
9565,"Wendy, you can take a picture?",Robin
9566,So if we continued the evening up there?,Lily
9567,Yeah.,Marshall
9568,Good idea. I have the tape.,Ted
9569,Barney is an intervention.,Robin
9570,"That's enough, the trick of &quot;old.&quot;",Marshall
9571,Forget it.,Lily
9572,I will get my problem.,Ted
9573,You're going to get my boat?,Barney
9574,Hi.,Ted
9575,Hi. How are you?,Lily
9576,It was just dinner with her sister Stella and her boyfriend.They married before us.,Ted
9577,Yeah.,Lily
9578,Bluntly.,Marshall
9579,It seems that the lamb is great here.,Ted
9580,Did you need protein. I take the lamb.,Ted
9581,"New objective: Our marriage is to kick the ass of hers.Our marriage is to take the head of his, press it down the toilet and flush 20 times.",Ted
9582,"Ted, in high school, his marriage was you, right?",Lily
9583,Hard to know where is the problem.,Ted
9584,"No, Stella, it should help. Pay for dinner. Do not worry.Taking Charge.",Ted
9585,We get married on Sunday? It is sure to be ready for this?,Ted
9586,I'm leaving. And I'm also... spontaneous. (He throws a glass of water on his face) I would not have done that.,Ted
9587,"We need you to come, this is my marriage.",Ted
9588,"I can not. I am in Tokyo. This is my first week. I can not leave like this. In addition, I am finally serious information.",Robin
9589,The board of the Fed voted not to change the... rates.,Robin
9590,This is my marriage. You gotta be there.,Ted
9591,"OK, I'll be there. I gotta go. Good evening. And I'm Robin Scherbatsky. The talks have been arrested in the Middle East. Despite a promising start in the final negotiations, the talks foundered on security.",Robin
9592,It is.,Ted
9593,"Okay, burial of bachelorhood. Tonight, I have three exotic dancers most flexible physically and mentally that you've ever seen...",Barney
9594,No time.,Ted
9595,I'll tell you.,Barney
9596,Do we really have to rent the cars for tomorrow.,Ted
9597,What?,Barney
9598,"No &quot;You not married, Ted?&quot; No &quot;You're making a big mistake, Ted?&quot; Have you stopped the fight against marriage?",Lily
9599,"No, I recognize a lost cause, when I see it. That's why I'm not recycle. In addition, Ted getting married, it is my interest. You know...",Barney
9600,"I worked on an issue of utmost importance. I admit I was baffled. Until I decided to take the bull by the horns.(Barney written on a board: how to lie down again with Robin) Then, finally, I dÃ©cryptais code. &quot;GIVE THE MARRIAGE OF TED. &quot;",Barney
9601,So you come back to Robin.,Lily
9602,Let's hope. This weekend is my best chance to start with it.,Barney
9603,"You'll never there. Too many opportunities. The first bridesmaid drunk, you'll have your head under the dress as a photographer of yesteryear.",Lily
9604,"Lily, kidding. I want to look cutesy and romantic, but this weekend, Robin will be the only girl that I will draw.",Barney
9605,It's not really the place I imagined for the wedding of Ted.,Lily
9606,&quot;The Collective Namaste Yoga and Meditation.&quot;,Barney
9607,"I know about you, but I will not namaster here too long.",Marshall
9608,"Honey, will see the dirty hippie to the reservation there, we, we'll take to drink.",Lily
9609,You have anything like Scotch?,Barney
9610,"Super, meals included, right?",Marshall
9611,"I need alcohol. I'm not gonna do that stuff with Robin.Look at that. Berry cocktail, conditioner meninges. I dream, these drinks could make a girl smarter. What hell Ted brought us?",Barney
9612,There's no meat.,Marshall
9613,There's no alcohol.,Lily
9614,"Even worse, I'm 90% sure that this kind in which you spoke was the lead singer of Spin Doctors.",Marshall
9615,"Guys, Stella and I have a little problem.",Ted
9616,"Actually, I spoke to Robin. It is a little late, but it will be there on time.",Ted
9617,"Yes, of course.",Ted
9618,Can I help you? Are you happy. You like him.,Ted
9619,But no.,Ted
9620,Your new husband dismounted me out three times a day.,Robin
9621,"Come on, we're friends. In addition, we already had our Thanksgiving last relapse, it is not old.",Ted
9622,She already has his ticket.,Ted
9623,It would not bother me. Tony is great. Invite him too.,Ted
9624,"Robin will soon get on the plane. In addition, it unleashed a lot of work for that.",Ted
9625,"Driven by concerns about the environment and oil prices, sales of hybrid vehicles rose 11% over last year.",Robin
9626,What should I do?,Ted
9627,I know. I understand something is &quot;no ex&quot;. Why would we want that history failed to come see one successful?It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners World Series. It's embarrassing for everyone.,Marshall
9628,What? No. Robin must come.,Barney
9629,"That's true, this is my best friend. Girl friend. My best friend girl.",Ted
9630,"I do not care, why do such.",Lily
9631,"Dude, Robin has to be there.",Barney
9632,It should not come.,Marshall
9633,What are you parl...,Barney
9634,"Aldrin Justice, the last word.",Ted
9635,"OK, this would be weird without Robin. But not contradict the bride.",Lily
9636,I will not tell him to come.,Ted
9637,It's the right decision.,Marshall
9638,It's gonna be the worst phone call of all time.,Ted
9639,"Co-witness, I'll handle this.",Barney
9640,Hello?,Robin
9641,"Robin, where are you?",Barney
9642,I'm off to the airport.,Robin
9643,"OK, in a few hours. Have a good flight. Bad news. I can not have it. Robin is gone.",Barney
9644,"OK, Robin arrives. You know, I'm fine. The former should be able to go to weddings. I'll tell Stella to do with.",Ted
9645,You should be more delicate with Stella about Robin.,Lily
9646,What do you mean by &quot;delicate&quot;?,Ted
9647,"The brides are very stressed before a wedding. Well, of course, I was under control.",Lily
9648,Do not you remember?,Marshall
9649,The florist told me that roses are medium pink pale pink that means. Medium pink pale! All're done. Our wedding hall uses a boiler instead of a forced air heating. This is the thing that concerned me. Why are we still married?,Lily
9650,"After a while, is that the waffle.",Marshall
9651,Poor Stella must be the crazy one month in three days.,Lily
9652,What do I do?,Ted
9653,"You wait for the next crisis, the rules you, you're a hero.After, you dealt with on about Robin, but this time she will say yes.",Lily
9654,And if there is no other crises?,Ted
9655,This is a bride. There will be another crisis.,Lily
9656,There is a new crisis.,Ted
9657,Great! What is it?,Lily
9658,What?,Ted
9659,"So, first thing tomorrow I'm going to talk to him, convince him to let me take Lucy, then boom, crisis solved. Stella is happy. Robin comes to marriage.",Ted
9660,Yes.,Barney
9661,I'm here with someone.,Barney
9662,You'll never get there.,Lily
9663,We did a little karate?,Ted
9664,OK.,Ted
9665,Not yet. Soon.,Ted
9666,"Actually, I've already had sex many times. Why I always corrects people?",Ted
9667,"Look, here's the thing...",Ted
9668,"Tony, stop. It is also a great day for Lucy. You'll have to put your problems aside and think about what is best for her.Whether you like it or not, it really should be the wedding of his mother. I take Lucy with me.",Ted
9669,Let's cuddle.,Ted
9670,But you're part of.,Ted
9671,You are now.,Ted
9672,"Dear wife, thank you for the interest you have for Barney Stinson...",Barney
9673,I regret to inform you that at this time...,Barney
9674,There are currently no positions available.,Barney
9675,"I will not do, huh?",Barney
9676,No chance.,Lily
9677,Let me talk to Stella first.,Ted
9678,What did Ted this time?,Robin
9679,To be fair... your ex is here.,Ted
9680,"Come on, it's not weird.",Ted
9681,I understand.,Robin
9682,You can talk to Tony? Robin made the trip from Tokyo. I should talk to him.,Ted
9683,Sorry to have run away like that.,Ted
9684,"It's OK. Can you imagine not traveling I did. I was on a plane, a whole day. But it was worth it to see you get married.How I would have missed it...",Robin
9685,You can not come to the wedding.,Ted
9686,thank you God!,Robin
9687,What?,Ted
9688,It's weird.,Robin
9689,It's not weird.,Ted
9690,It's weird. You know how it feels to be one of the former married?,Robin
9691,"It was broken, there is more than a year.",Ted
9692,"Yes, but it's not that long ago. See you marry another woman is not really something I look forward to. I just thought if I changed my mind about marriage and children, it was nice knowing you were there.",Robin
9693,"So, I was your backup plan. It's flattering.",Ted
9694,That's not it. It's just...,Robin
9695,Why do you mention that? There was nothing between us.,Ted
9696,"Maybe so. I mean, of course it does. The kind of thing that leaves no one fell swoop. I'm not a guest over.",Robin
9697,"It's true. We went out together, but... we have moved on.And we got what we wanted. I marry, You have the job of your dreams in Tokyo. And they lived happily...",Ted
9698,I quit my job.,Robin
9699,You what?,Ted
9700,"I return to New York. I thought I wanted this job, but...Getting back to my real life. And you should go back to yours.",Robin
9701,What does that mean?,Ted
9702,"You married. Listen, this is precipitated. It's as if you started a book by the end. You are the most romantic. You stole a blue horn for me. You tried to make rain.",Robin
9703,I did the rain.,Ted
9704,"It was a coincidence. After all this is how your romantic quest comes to an end? You hide in the wedding of another in his house in his life, without thinking twice. This is not the end spectacular than you deserve. It's not Ted Mosby.",Robin
9705,I love Stella. This is good. If you feel it all... I think it is good that you come to the marriage.,Ted
9706,Yes.,Robin
9707,"You stop it. (Robin drinks the glass of a sudden) My God, so, stop.",Robin
9708,I spend a very bad day. I've stolen scotch at the duty free. It tells you?,Robin
9709,Let's go to your room. Far from it. And can be the whistle.,Barney
9710,"I have no room. In fact, I thought I could stay with you.",Robin
9711,No problem. I just need to tidy up a little. Of clothes on the floor and...,Barney
9712,"And a girl naked, tied to your bed.",Robin
9713,"The towels in the bathroom, a real mess. So, give me 10 minutes... to restore order...",Barney
9714,"In addition, Barney.",Robin
9715,The girl on reception.,Barney
9716,"It's funny when I think about it. I was sure that Stella was good. When she left me, I was so devastated. But you helped me overcome that. Now the hard part is over. I came out a little louder. You know, I do not think further of it. This is the work of time, I guess.",Ted
9717,"Ted, the wedding was yesterday. It's been 24 hours.",Lily
9718,"I know. That's all I advance. A new chapter in my life begins today, and we'll celebrate. Here, we need two things.We need Kool and the Gang. It's time the jukebox!",Ted
9719,"I watch this young man dancing near the jukebox, and I can not help thinking... Stella may have made the right choice. Ouch!",Barney
9720,How can he dance here? He should be trying to smash the car with a club of Stella.,Marshall
9721,"Assumption. He is not pretending to be happy. Ted is really happy. He did not want to marry from the start. Ted had the best train dodge since Stand by Me Well, not the first kid, but others.",Barney
9722,"No, it is a mess.",Lily
9723,It gauze?,Ted
9724,A mess. And one must be there for him.,Lily
9725,"Hey, man.",Lily
9726,You wanna hang out?,Robin
9727,"Girls, I'm fine.",Ted
9728,"Dude, you make some?",Marshall
9729,I'm fine.,Ted
9730,"Hey, kid.",Barney
9731,"Barney, I'm fine! It is not necessary, and it is rather unhealthy. Sorry, ladies.",Ted
9732,I did not know you'd be here. Girls stairwell.,Barney
9733,What do you want for dinner?,Ted
9734,"Oh, the farm. I'm sorry, is that you have experienced something traumatic, and we try to be there for you, but do not you leave us, and it irritates us, selfish little whore. Sorry.",Lily
9735,We are concerned that you faced not what happened with Stella. Do you remember when Lily left me? How I buried my emotions?,Marshall
9736,It... I... miss him so much.,Marshall
9737,"Yeah man, you've been a rock.",Robin
9738,"I should have been worse, OK? I should have my nerves, follow your advice and burn cases Lily.",Marshall
9739,"Super. Thank you, Ted.",Lily
9740,"I have not done it, and that's why I took so long to get better. So Ted, I want you explode. Release your rage.Ready? Now!",Marshall
9741,It's OK.,Ted
9742,"Guys, let him go. He is happy. Listen, if Ted was married, then he would be married, he would live in New Jersey, and he would be married. It is well. Good, let's eat. Let Flat Michael's?",Barney
9743,It is between the 44th and Lex. Impossible.,Ted
9744,Why?,Robin
9745,"It is near the gym Stella. We could cross. Everywhere else, it's going.",Ted
9746,"Ok, how about Hurley's?",Robin
9747,Stack between his office and dry cleaner. Sorry.,Ted
9748,"Well, The Meatloaf Charlie?",Lily
9749,Two blocks from her mother's hairdresser.,Ted
9750,"Okay, Ted, is there a place in Manhattan where one can dine?",Barney
9751,Of course. Look at this.,Ted
9752,It's that thing?,Robin
9753,A reference card I made. A guide to places where you can meet Stella Zinman. The red areas: to avoid. White: OK.Blue: the sea,Ted
9754,This is ridiculous.,Lily
9755,The sea is blue.,Robin
9756,You can not live like this.,Lily
9757,"It leaves you on the altar, and it's you who're avoiding?",Marshall
9758,"Yes, I avoid it. What is the problem? It goes like this.",Ted
9759,It's that &quot;one&quot; small dicks?,Marshall
9760,"No, 'on', it is the people of the great state of Ohio. When life is hard, we take the pain and bury us. And if the pain goes, is buried pain over another. Why cope when you can avoid?All I have to do is to never see her again, and I will have a long happy life. So who wants to eat?",Ted
9761,Someone told me of a tapas bar located in the white zone.,Lily
9762,Super. Let's go.,Ted
9763,Not yet. Can we have almonds to the table?,Ted
9764,"Well done, Lily. This place looks cool. That you talked about?",Ted
9765,I actually remember it. Oh Oh!,Lily
9766,What?,Robin
9767,I remember.,Lily
9768,"Oh my God! Oh my God! OK, stay cool. We'll just have to manage it. Everyone... follow me.",Ted
9769,"Oh, you laugh.",Marshall
9770,He is serious?,Lily
9771,"I will not in this table. Possibly, in this one.",Barney
9772,She turns around.,Robin
9773,"Think, think. Guys, stay there. I'll take a look. Marshall will look.",Ted
9774,She took to win.,Marshall
9775,She looks happy? She talked about me? I do not care.Where are the almonds?,Ted
9776,Where may well be nuts Ted? You should check the garage in the grip of Stella.,Barney
9777,Will the yelling.,Marshall
9778,"You're maybe Ohio, but you live in New York now. We do not bury our emotions in New York. We take our emotions and they are sent to the other side!",Lily
9779,Let me go. You'd do the same if you were in this situation.,Ted
9780,I dream! There's not one person on Earth to which I would hide under a table.,Lily
9781,"Really, not one? Not even... Gazeur?",Ted
9782,How dare you pronounce this name to me?,Lily
9783,Who is Gazeur?,Robin
9784,This is the last person I would like to see here. Michael purifier. This is a guy I was in high school.,Lily
9785,"Michael was next to me in Biology. It was a failure for the entire college, but the summer before the third, he grew 30 cm and joined the baseball team. It was becoming a cool guy.Until one day...",Lily
9786,"Lily, you're all been there. When we loose one, it's not pretty.",Barney
9787,You did what?,Robin
9788,Are you kidding? It was the third. I had a choice.,Lily
9789,"Oh, my God, purifier! It gauze?",Lily
9790,Of course purifier. Or rather Gazeur. Gazeur!,Lily
9791,"The Gazeur nickname stuck. He had so much ridicule, he had to change schools.",Lily
9792,The kids are great.,Barney
9793,"It made me always feel guilty. But if Gazeur... Michael...came now, as hard as it may be, I would go to Gazeur...Michael... and I should settle things between us.",Lily
9794,"Clearing the air, as before. Oh, man. It does not happen often. You are welcome.",Robin
9795,"Let's just eat here, if possible.",Ted
9796,Thank you. You have a daily special?,Ted
9797,"Ted, this is ridiculous.",Marshall
9798,"I am a person who... Well, are facing. There are a bunch of people I do not want to see... as the group of &quot;girls that I skipped&quot;... but if one of them came here, I would stay there, and I would look into his eyes. For some, this would be the first time.",Barney
9799,"Really, you hide from anybody? Not even... Becca Delucci?",Ted
9800,Son of a bitch.,Barney
9801,Do you mind?,Barney
9802,Who is Becca Delucci?,Robin
9803,Becca is this girl who lives in the North. I saw her from time to time.,Barney
9804,"Where exactly in the north, Barney?",Ted
9805,Bedford Hills Federal Penitentiary.,Barney
9806,"And yes, the visits were of a conjugal nature.",Barney
9807,That's not true?,Lily
9808,"Really. And that I had with Becca was a perfect relationship. She was allowed to call me once a week. If it becomes too sticky, the armed guards stoppaient. I've never had to pay for dinner. In fact, this is false. I pay taxes. I guess we all paid for dinner. Thank you, guys. Anyway, at the last visit, I screwed up.",Barney
9809,"I know it's hard, baby, but I'm in a prison too.Imprisoned in my heart. This room is ready or what? We can...?",Barney
9810,"That's why I'm here, baby. I am your strength. I'm...Oh, my God. Hello, stranger. (He hangs up with the first woman prisoner and will talk to another who has just arrived) Barney Stinson, attorney. Let's talk about your output.",Barney
9811,"Now I have letters from Becca who say, &quot;I'll come see you the day I get out of here. I'll hang your eyes in my rearview mirror. &quot;Women, eh?",Barney
9812,You see? Are you afraid of Becca. Lily is afraid of Gazeur. (Marshall head out from under the table) are still under the table.,Ted
9813,We do not need. Stella is a party.,Marshall
9814,"Oh, my God. That's it, and that's it, the style Ohio. The problem manifested itself. It has been avoided. It is a party.Here you can dine in peace...",Ted
9815,"It comes back. (They go back under the table) We all think that you need... Wait, where is Barney? (Barney is in the next table) We think you should talk to him.",Marshall
9816,Not me.,Robin
9817,What?,Marshall
9818,"If the last person I wanted to see, came in I would not talk to him.",Robin
9819,Really?,Ted
9820,Who is it?,Lily
9821,My father.,Robin
9822,"Boy, this sure is another table. What are we talking?",Barney
9823,From Robin's father.,Lily
9824,I have not spoken to him in 3 years and I want to start now.,Robin
9825,Why?,Lily
9826,It goes back to my birth.,Robin
9827,He wanted a son and the fact that I am a girl has not changed.,Robin
9828,How so?,Ted
9829,"My full name is Robin Charles Scherbatsky, Jr. And it only got worse.",Robin
9830,"At 8, he took me hunting for the first time. I want to sh**t a deer.",Robin
9831,But they're cute.,Robin
9832,My body started to change...,Robin
9833,"Wait a second. Sorry, continues.",Barney
9834,It was increasingly hard for him to act as if I was a boy.,Robin
9835,The worst moment came in my 14 years. My junior hockey team had just won the &quot;Squamish Invitational.&quot; And everybody came to my house to celebrate.,Robin
9836,You're an idiot.,Robin
9837,"My poor. Being forced to grow up in Canada with America, right next door.",Barney
9838,"It's sad for your father, Robin, but congratulations for this game.",Marshall
9839,And Kyle and I are doing anything serious. It was only the blue line.,Robin
9840,The blue line?,Barney
9841,"You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that &quot;crease&quot; speaks for itself. After that, my relationship with my father has cooled. I moved with my mother, let my hair grow, was a Canadian pop star. Young normal stuff.",Robin
9842,You do not think you'd feel better if you talked to him?,Lily
9843,"That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what? &quot;I wish not to be raised as a boy, that thou teach me not to hunt, fish and smoke cigars and drinking scotch because girls do not do that. And you know why I run like a girl? Because I am one. &quot;",Robin
9844,"You kept it for quite some time, eh?",Ted
9845,Yes.,Robin
9846,It has returned to you.,Ted
9847,Sorry.,Marshall
9848,It's hot.,Barney
9849,"I'll talk to him. (They go out from under the table, but Stella is gone) She's gone. I'll catch up.",Ted
9850,"There, there.",Barney
9851,There she is!,Ted
9852,"I see. It is two taxis right front. Not lose it, OK?",Ted
9853,"Well, well you do. You're going to confront it.",Marshall
9854,I will face it.,Ted
9855,This is so exciting.,Robin
9856,Bluntly.,Ted
9857,You're gonna say what?,Lily
9858,"I will say, &quot;Sorry it did not work. &quot;We will discuss in adults. She'll tell me his views and... I will listen. What I should have done more before.",Ted
9859,"You can fly it into the lamp? Fasten your seat belts!Not you, Ted.",Barney
9860,You have to get angry. Go ahead. Looking good.,Marshall
9861,"Come on. There is no question of moving his arms, stomping feet and get angry. This is Stella and I finally communicating. Clearly, it was...",Ted
9862,Stella hated Star Wars. She lied to you. Seeking your feelings. You know it's true.,Marshall
9863,That's his problem.,Ted
9864,"Come on, Ted. She left you on the altar.",Barney
9865,I understand!,Robin
9866,In the name of all that is sacred...,Ted
9867,"Wait, wait! Where it goes? His taxi has missed the exit for the Lincoln Tunnel.",Lily
9868,"Why take it away to bring him back in New Jersey, anyway?",Robin
9869,Maybe she goes to his office.,Ted
9870,No.,Marshall
9871,The waiter asked him: &quot;Do you want covered? &quot;And she said:&quot; I'm going home. &quot;,Marshall
9872,"If she goes to her, why you go to...? Oh, my God. Tony lives in the city center. &quot;At home&quot; is Tony's apartment. She would move in with me in New Jersey and moved to town, Tony? The bitch!",Ted
9873,"Finally. Finally, my friend.",Marshall
9874,I have the balls too!,Ted
9875,"I know and I love it! It's great! Sir, we will pay gladly handle that has been broken. I love Ted angry!",Marshall
9876,Me too!,Ted
9877,"Lets get out, man, let out.",Marshall
9878,She stops.,Lily
9879,That's it. That's it!,Ted
9880,"Yes, Ted. Come on, buddy!",Marshall
9881,Get rid of your demons!,Robin
9882,I have ants in my leg!,Barney
9883,"OK, wait. Wait...",Lily
9884,What are you doing?,Marshall
9885,"Wait. Listen, Ted, it's great that you're angry...",Lily
9886,Sure.,Marshall
9887,"... and that you face all that, but... you only have one chance. Take a moment and think about what you will say.",Lily
9888,"I know exactly what I say. (Ted comes out of the taxi) You chose the wrong guy. You chose the wrong guy. You did a very, very, very bad choice. What were you thinking? This guy? You kidding me? Have you learned anything these past 8 years? You'll be sorry. You know it? You'll be sorry, and you can do anything about it because it is too late. Anything you can do is start up your life miserable and disappointing that will never be as happy as it could be with me. Goodbye.",Ted
9889,"Look, I'm not there to pick you. I am here because I need to know that you know you've made the worst mistake of your life.",Ted
9890,Okay. (Ted is still in the taxi) This is what I say.,Ted
9891,It k*ll!,Marshall
9892,From cold bl*od.,Barney
9893,"Okay, tell him that.",Lily
9894,"I'm not impressed by the talent here tonight. And more I drink, the less it is attractive. I'm a whiskey and Coke in the Cantina scene in Star Wars.",Barney
9895,And those girls over there? They are cannon.,Ted
9896,Absolutely not.,Barney
9897,"Are you kidding? I have hated as soon as I saw them. So they are cannon. In fact, I've hated almost as much as Robin when I've ever known.",Lily
9898,You hate me?,Robin
9899,A max.,Lily
9900,"Barney, they are canon.",Marshall
9901,"There is so much to learn. You are only v*ctim of...the effect cheerleaders. Good question. The effect cheerleading is when a group of women air cannon, but only in groups. As with the cheerleaders. They look like cannon, but take them individually? Cod.",Barney
9902,Anything.,Ted
9903,Look at it carefully. Individually.,Barney
9904,I know. The last one is kinda cute.,Marshall
9905,"Yeah, really cute.",Lily
9906,"And this, my friends, is &quot;the effect cheerleaders.&quot; Also known as the paradox of a bridesmaid syndrome sorority, and for a brief moment in the 90s, the conspiracy of the Spice Girls.Scary Spice, indeed. (His phone rings) Barney Stinson. OK.Understood. Great, we remember.",Barney
9907,What?,Ted
9908,"Apparently, I'll be a father.",Barney
9909,You're gonna be a father? How will it happen?,Ted
9910,It's a girl I plugged in a few weeks ago. It is not certain.She sees the doctor tomorrow.,Barney
9911,That may be a false alarm. It is perhaps not pregnant.,Lily
9912,"No part of Barney Stinson does not run at less than 110%. If one of my Michael Phelps escaped, he swims for gold. It's a nightmare. I want no children. How can want to have children without being mad?",Barney
9913,"You have not lost a sock, little guy? This is probably the cutest little thing I've ever seen.",Marshall
9914,"So if you have a baby, you think you can work less?",Lily
9915,"No matter, it will be so cute, I'm going to exhaust the first day.",Marshall
9916,And for the money? It has a ton of debt.,Lily
9917,We count the unpaid bills on her pretty little fingers.Let's make a baby.,Marshall
9918,Now?,Lily
9919,Push yourself. I recorded The View. This problem and was unemployed and sleeping on the couch.,Robin
9920,"So, Robin, when you're in for the job and apartment?",Marshall
9921,"Are not you aware? I am a presenter on CNN. And I have made gold a terrace overlooking Central Park. Get out of your ass's head, Marshall.",Robin
9922,"Robin, would you mind not sleeping with Ted tomorrow night? I... prepares a special dinner for Marshall.",Lily
9923,Just a dinner. That's it. Nothing else.,Marshall
9924,"Okay, but you better not be as they stuck together when I cans on the roof. &quot;My ears. The neighbors called the cops.You almost hit me. &quot;",Robin
9925,Enjoy it. It is a good time.,Marshall
9926,"God? It's me, Barney. Are you okay? I know we will not speak often, a bunch of girls said your name on my account. Great. But, God... If you could get out of there, I swear I'll never, never... never, never, never... (His phone rings and people have turned to him) Wait, man. Barney to the device.Really?",Barney
9927,Good news! I'm not a father!,Barney
9928,"Congratulations, buddy.",Marshall
9929,"This is the best time of my life, Marshall. What I feel in having no children? I have never thought something like it as much. That's why I created a public holiday. Now, today is &quot;Day of Non-fathers.&quot;",Barney
9930,You create a holiday?,Marshall
9931,"Why not? Everyone has one: mothers, fathers, soldiers. Why not a day for singles who like it?",Barney
9932,It looks like a big day of Valentine's Day.,Marshall
9933,Hi. How are the children?,Barney
9934,"That's between me and my wife, sir.",Marshall
9935,I thought it was a lunch.,Marshall
9936,Marshall?,Lily
9937,Baby. It's lunchtime in China.,Marshall
9938,Yeah.,Lily
9939,"It's not a euphemism. Listen... Wait, what does that mean?",Marshall
9940,"I know, hot bread, spicy pork? Stuff like that. You come not tonight, right? You shake your head for &quot;no&quot;? That's what I thought.",Lily
9941,Thank you for coming so quickly.,Lily
9942,Are you okay? You looked upset on the phone.,Robin
9943,"Marshall and I, we took the decision to have a great...dinner. And I thought I was ready for a... dinner. But he called to cancel, and it got me thinking. Is it too early for us to make a... Dinner?",Lily
9944,"I had lunch early, so I can eat.",Ted
9945,"Dinner, it's a baby!",Lily
9946,"Lily, it's horrible!",Robin
9947,"No, I need you to clarify a situation for me.",Lily
9948,What?,Robin
9949,"Are we ready, Marshall and me to have a baby? So, are we ready to have a baby or not?",Lily
9950,We can not decide for you. It's huge.,Ted
9951,You know what is huge? Marshall's head. It is as big as a watermelon in late August. Marshall's baby who is passing by?,Robin
9952,He thinks what?,Ted
9953,A lot of things in the helmet of the space of 50 years who serves as its head.,Robin
9954,Marshall is really excited. But I think he sees only the good sides of it.,Lily
9955,"The other day while playing with the little Jeremy, I was talking with his mother.",Lily
9956,"I will be as carbon copy Charlotte. Worse. At least, her husband works at home. Well, he deale of shit, but it is a caring father.",Lily
9957,Marshall is a very good father.,Ted
9958,"Marshall is always at work, and I'm afraid to hit all the work if we have one now.",Lily
9959,You panic and you see only bad side.,Ted
9960,I think it's just realistic.,Robin
9961,"Well, that's perfect. That's why I called you. Ted, you're for children. Robin, you're against. Councillors, please proceed.",Lily
9962,"OK, I know you're afraid of not being ready. But we think ever be. You just take the plunge and it will come naturally.",Ted
9963,"Of course for you, it is natural, you're practically already a father.",Robin
9964,You're a father too.,Lily
9965,What are you talking?,Ted
9966,"Ted, thoughtful. You go out jokes father of super lame.",Robin
9967,A cereal k*ll! A cereal k*ll!,Ted
9968,You make us moral. Like when you broke your ship in a bottle.,Robin
9969,I'm not sorry. I'm just disappointed.,Ted
9970,That's it!,Barney
9971,Shut up!,Robin
9972,And you do that thing that all fathers are with the waitresses.,Robin
9973,"Hello, Lori, me, this is Ted. I will be your customer tonight.Before leaving, tell me. What is a k*ll in a wheat field? No index.",Ted
9974,"She's right. Perhaps you're single and childless, but you're really a redneck dad.",Lily
9975,"I do not appreciate that tone, young lady.",Ted
9976,The No-Fathers Day is a success! Laraby Finklestein and help me celebrate. Matt. Mugs &quot;Best Non-Father of the world.&quot; There... T-shirts &quot;Who is your daddy? &quot;Available on fetedesnonperes.com. Looking greeting cards.,Barney

9978,Look at the illustration.,Barney
9979,It looks like an Asian hooker.,Marshall
9980,"Because at the Non-Fathers Day, you have a Thai girl you a blowjob. Tope, puns!",Barney
9981,"It puts you in the mash, then. Your only hope is to be negative.",Lily
9982,I'll tell you why my opponent says it all. Three words: fear of... babies.,Ted
9983,What? You're crazy. This is false.,Robin
9984,Really?,Ted
9985,And when we saw my cousin and her baby? She's so cute!,Ted
9986,Where the party that Lily had done for her friend Erika?You do feel for this baby?,Ted

9988,And do not forget...,Ted
9989,Pub with baby talk?,Marshall
9990,Pub with baby talk.,Ted
9991,But you're not like that. You like children too.,Ted
9992,"Yes, I'm lovely, beautiful and brilliant, but it's enough?",Lily
9993,"It comes down to one word: &quot;you&quot;. Are you ready to put your dreams in the background? Back in college, taught art at the university? You have to concentrate on the project before starting Lily Baby Project. Otherwise, you'll regret it forever.And it would be good neither for you nor for the baby. What is it?",Robin
9994,The sock Jeremy. I will make a baby.,Lily
9995,"Well, and everything I said?",Robin
9996,But sock.,Lily

10002,"I think you're taking a &quot;chausettogari&quot;, eh, Robin?",Ted
10003,"Shut up, Dad.",Robin
10004,"You, shut up, baby-phobic.",Ted
10005,"Babies are scary, OK? With their giant eyes. And seriously, the fontanelle? If there is a self-destruct button, at least, hide it where it will not accidentally press.",Robin
10006,Where is Lily? You have to drink?,Ted
10007,Not a drop.,Robin
10008,I do not either.,Ted
10009,"Put a baby in me, Marshall. I'm ready.",Lily

10046,"Robin Scherbatsky, you get the idea of having children?",Ted
10047,"I know. One day, perhaps. When I'm 70. Science will catch me. I'm just... I'm lost right now. I'm unemployed, I live on a couch.",Robin
10048,There were two difficult months both. I have a room free.Why not come to me in the meantime?,Ted

10068,Of course.,Lily
10069,Baby...,Marshall
10070,I blame myself for last night. I was really painful. I just panicked at the thought of whether we are ready to parent. But you are so well taken care of me. I know you're gonna be a good father.,Lily
10071,I want to be a father now.,Marshall
10072,What?,Lily
10073,"Last night, it was just... I share between work and drunk baby Lily, it was too. I just begin with this job, I work long hours... I love you. And I really want to have children one day.I just want... I want to be ready for that.",Marshall
10074,"Me too. When we're ready, I know you'll be fantastic.",Lily
10075,You too.,Marshall
10076,"You wanna make love, by protecting themselves now?",Lily
10077,Yes.,Marshall
10078,You want to finish your bacon first?,Lily
10079,You're the perfect woman.,Marshall
10080,"&quot;And the cat is in the cradle and the silver spoon Little Boy Blue and the Man on the Moon. When are you going back home, Dad? I do not know when we're together then, son I know we will have a good time. &quot;",Barney
10081,"So, it seems that Marshall has to work late on Friday.You know what that means, party girls.",Robin
10082,"Well, a teacher at my school, Jillian, a birthday. What?",Lily
10083,"It's just that... I have never heard of this before Jillian, and suddenly, it's your best friend. You do not stop talking about her.",Robin
10084,Do not be jealous. We hang out together all the time.,Lily
10085,"Yeah, but Marshall is still there. There was not much time to talk, just us two.",Robin
10086,This is false.,Lily
10087,This is where the story gets really good. So it goes...,Robin
10088,Hi.,Marshall
10089,"... place. And then this... guy talking about this thing with the stuff of which I spoke the other day about this place.Well, anyway... it happened.",Robin
10090,My God. You and the guy the mayor's office did it to the UN under the office of Ambassador of Zaire? Cool.,Marshall
10091,"I wish we had time for girls. I love Marshall, but I am not free to express myself.",Robin
10092,"Come with me and Jillian, then.",Lily
10093,"OK, but I want to stay too late because... (Marshall and Ted joined them at the table) Do you remember... this thing last month after going there? You know who said it was going, but she gave me tips.",Robin
10094,You always mycoses?,Marshall
10095,I want to take this moment.,Barney
10096,Which one?,Marshall
10097,The last time you and I are just competing for the title of best friend Ted.,Barney
10098,Marshall is my best friend.,Ted
10099,Exactly. Draw. But it's all about to change. Is it correct that you are an architect?,Barney
10100,"My best friend does not, but still.",Ted
10101,You draw what now?,Barney
10102,"Well, you renovate the library Nouillorc.",Ted
10103,That's great!,Robin
10104,"No, not the New York Public Library. This is the library Nouillorc, in Dakota. Their books are in two parts: fishing and not fishing.",Ted
10105,I think you'll love what's happened at work.,Barney
10106,Who's going to draw?,Ted
10107,That was my first question.,Barney
10108,Who's going to draw?,Barney
10109,Sven?,Ted
10110,I hate them. Swedish architecture collective.,Ted
10111,No one.,Robin
10112,Pretentious.,Lily
10113,&quot;It is not a company. It is a collective. &quot;,Ted
10114,I know. &quot;We're Swedish. It's so cool with our baguettes and our Eiffel Tower. &quot;,Barney
10115,"Sweden, this is not France. You know that?",Marshall
10116,"It's France. No matter, I told Bilson...",Barney
10117,"Bislon, saving your...",Barney
10118,"No, I get up, and I told Bilson...",Barney
10119,"Bislon, saving your...",Barney
10120,Music. Imagine a patriotic music.,Barney
10121,"Bilson, with all due respect... it would be terrible if a job that would suit American architects was relevant to a band of French. Where is our patriotism? Love of country? Our love of all that...",Barney
10122,Yes. I know a great American architect who would be perfect. Ted Mosby.,Barney
10123,"All you have to do is come and offer your drawing, I take care of the Board, the project is yours.",Barney
10124,You realize what a hero I'd be if I brought this project to my box?,Ted
10125,"It's not the best. We three, we'll work together.",Barney
10126,Ted will come to call.,Marshall
10127,"Yes, totally.",Barney
10128,What is it?,Ted
10129,It works like this: one of us goes into the office the other and said...,Barney
10130,"Marshall, the teleconference begins soon.",Barney
10131,"Sorry, I gotta go.",Marshall
10132,And then you go up on the roof... and drink beer.,Barney
10133,It's great. Drinking at work.,Marshall
10134,"Basically, it is of &quot;Mad Men.&quot;",Barney
10135,Yes! There is too much &quot;Mad Men&quot;!,Marshall
10136,I'll spank a secretary.,Barney
10137,That's exactly what they would do in this series.,Marshall
10138,What series?,Barney
10139,And then you throw the bodies of cans at pigeons.,Barney
10140,I do not do that.,Marshall
10141,I love to do that.,Ted
10142,I will realize your dream.,Barney
10143,"Seriously, Barney, from what I've lived with Stella, I have this opportunity... it touches me.",Ted
10144,"Your friend has a birthday here? She has what, 19?",Robin
10145,"No. Believe me, it's not his style. She must not know what kind of place this is.",Lily
10146,"Oh, my God. At school, she is so calm and normal. I thought it was not... a Woo.",Lily
10147,"I swear, at school, Jillian is not so Woo.",Lily
10148,It was not like a Woo. Perhaps it is that holidays like Mardi Gras and the day of the year. Maybe this is a cyclical Woo.,Robin
10149,"Okay, be cool with me. This is a first draft.",Ted
10150,"Ted, it's incredible. Detail. Shadows. The liveliness of the lines. This is exactly what Princess Leia would look like, topless.",Barney
10151,"My way of saying thank you. Okay, you wanna see my designs for the building?",Ted
10152,"No, that's fine.",Barney
10153,"Listen to this. Lily sent me a text message. It was at this bar, The Giddy Ups with full of Woos.",Marshall
10154,"So, Jillian, it seems that when you not flash the bartenders, you are mistress of CE1. How is it?",Robin
10155,No thank you... drag ignorant.,Lily
10156,"Lily Aldrin, little secretive. For years, I say that our gang needs a Woo, and thou hast hid me in a whole herd.",Barney
10157,You do not need a Woo. Nobody needs it.,Lily
10158,"Attention Lily. The world badly needs the Woos. If there were not Woos, there would not Girls Gone Wild, no bachelor party girl, no pool bar in Las Vegas... all the things you hold dear would not exist.",Barney
10159,None of this stuff...,Lily
10160,"Industry sh**t memories would collapse. Just like the glitter body and that of Hummer limos. The mini cowboy hats would be worn by the little cowboys. And when &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; happen on a jukebox, you do not hear... that silence. And &quot;Brown Eyed Girl.&quot; But who would Woo, Lily?Who would woo? Would you? You'd... Woo?",Barney
10161,"Well you'll excuse me, I have a date with Bataille and Fontaine.",Barney
10162,"And we think this design will radiate timeless power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen.",Ted
10163,"Hey, Barney! Give me the good news.",Ted
10164,You did not have.,Barney
10165,What?,Ted
10166,The Board... Sven decided to choose.,Barney
10167,I can not believe I had not. I thought I had hit the nail. Why did they choose Sven?,Ted
10168,I've done everything to change their minds. But they did not budge. I'm sorry.,Barney
10169,It's really bad. After the way the last few months have passed... I guess I'd need more than I thought.,Ted
10170,"You want to go to the current GNB building and just... I dunno, just a little pee on it?",Marshall
10171,I think I need it.,Ted
10172,Finish Your Beer. Fill the machine.,Barney
10173,It's been what?,Robin
10174,Ted did not get the job. But this is not the biggest disappointment of the day.,Lily
10175,What?,Robin
10176,You were seen to Woo.,Lily
10177,"Given that, do Woo?",Robin
10178,You who did Woo?,Lily
10179,I have not done Woo.,Robin
10180,"Oh, yes.",Lily
10181,That's not true.,Robin
10182,Your nose is growing. You've become best friends with Jillian now?,Lily
10183,"It's just... You're married, I'm still single. Whenever I'm with you, I'm usually the 3rd wheel. Sometimes it's nice to go out with other singles and doing stuff you do not.",Robin
10184,Like what?,Lily
10185,"As to Woo, Lily. As to Woo.",Robin
10186,I can Woo.,Lily
10187,That's not true.,Robin
10188,But if.,Lily
10189,"It's not you, that.",Robin
10190,"Bilson? I just wanna say, I know that you chose Sven, but... Ted Mosby is extremely talented, and... he would have made a hell of a job.",Marshall
10191,It's okay. All withdrawals at ATMs are free.,Barney
10192,Teleconference. Now.,Marshall
10193,You wanna tell me something?,Marshall
10194,Good grief. I told Heather to put everything back as it was on your desk.,Barney
10195,Bilson told me he wanted to give the job to Ted.What has happened?,Marshall
10196,Okay.,Barney
10197,"... will radiate power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen.",Ted
10198,So?,Barney
10199,It looks like we had our man. I not think there need to see...,Barney
10200,"Oh, my God. It's me!",Barney
10201,"I've never known so far, but I've always wanted.",Barney
10202,What does this button?,Barney
10203,It's building the coolest of the universe. It could not be more awesome.,Barney
10204,"What is your problem? This is the big break of Ted!You have betrayed to work in the brain of a Tyrannosaurus, which, incidentally, if you knew the dinosaurs is very, very small.",Marshall
10205,It's not my office. The building was well Ted. That of Sven was better. And I will not let the fact that I am the best friend of Ted influence business.,Barney
10206,You have not chosen one of Sven because he was better. You wanted an office dinosaur.,Marshall
10207,"It's a lie! I chose it because it... He breathes fire, Marshall.",Barney
10208,&quot;Fire Marshall&quot;.,Marshall
10209,I have not even paid attention.,Barney
10210,How could you do that to Ted after all that happened with Stella? You are an egoist.,Marshall
10211,"I never made a career choice by selfishness. I am a professional. Go. Spend a good day, drunk, and throw the bodies of the pigeons.",Barney
10212,"No. For two reasons. A, pigeons are smarter than you think. They are resentful. And two, it's our last conference call, Mr. Stinson. There are repercussions to ride a friend.",Marshall
10213,Like what?,Barney
10214,"Because, that.",Marshall
10215,Someone won a trip buttocks until the first dance floor of the canyon of spanking!,Robin
10216,Wooo!,Lily
10217,What are you doing here?,Robin
10218,The same things are funny as singles.,Lily
10219,That's what the fireman's helmet?,Robin
10220,"I had no cowboy hat, and it was the day of fire safety at school... My God, ***** s. This is our theme.",Lily
10221,Really? Who sings that?,Robin
10222,LL Cool J stuff always comes out?,Lily
10223,"That's great, Sven. You are so much cooler than Marshall. He has not even mix. Who wants a foam?",Barney
10224,"It's the call. Got it? In America, when we work late, you lie on a conference call, and here we ascend a few beers. It's great.",Barney
10225,You are a bunch of prostitutes. You must have STDs.,Lily
10226,"Lily, it does not work. You should not be there.",Robin
10227,"I get it. Because I am happily married, I'm a schmuck?",Lily
10228,"On the contrary. Why do you think the Woo Woos have to when they win a drinking game? Or when a guy takes off his g*n t-shirt? Because that's all that life brings. These are...People really sad. And when she go out with someone who has it all, someone like you, it's disappointing. It takes them Woo.",Robin
10229,You say that to make me feel not like an old married.,Lily
10230,Look at those girls. Look at them and listen to what they mean Woo.,Robin
10231,Wooo! (&quot;My career and my love life going nowhere!&quot;),Ted
10232,The poor girls... and Ted. I want to give them a hug.,Lily
10233,"Right now I am like them. I have no job, no boyfriend, I'm confused. So... occasionally, I need to Woo, but when I need to talk about something concrete, it is to you I turn. You're my best friend.",Robin
10234,"And you, mine. And I promise to dedicate ourselves more time. Marshall did not need to paste something from being done.",Lily
10235,You have tested those purple shots in test tubes? I took five. I believe that there is no alcohol in it.,Marshall
10236,Where did you get that hat?,Lily
10237,What hat?,Marshall
10238,It turned Sven.,Barney
10239,What?,Ted
10240,"Those guys were morons. Of course, they had cool ideas... really cool ideas. In fact, I wonder if it's not too late...The fact is: you have the job.",Barney
10241,Really?,Ted
10242,"The committee realized he had erred. In addition, you are precious to them and they want you to be happy.",Barney
10243,It's weird.,Ted
10244,"Your plans were the best and you deserve it. You should know one thing that you did not get the job early. You see, Ted...",Barney
10245,"It was Bilson. Bilson wanted to have a head office in the dinosaur, Barney convinced him that it was really, really stupid.",Marshall
10246,You know...,Barney
10247,"Thank you, Barney. I believe it. I brought in my box the largest contract that she had. Wooo! (&quot;Now, only my love life is a disaster!&quot;) The next is for me.",Ted
10248,Why you helped me?,Barney
10249,"You did the right thing. You got a well deserved boost. And then it would have disappointed Ted, and it is finally... very happy for the moment.",Marshall
10250,"You are truly the best friend Ted. And me too. Tie.Thank you, Marshall.",Barney
10251,"I love you, man.",Ted
10252,"Me too, buddy.",Barney
10253,You mount the bull?,Ted
10254,"No, even if you pay me. I have an inner ear problem.",Barney
10255,"That's right, girls.",Barney
10256,Half the time the relationship.,Lily
10257,One week per month spent together.,Marshall
10258,"Just 10,000 glasses. No matter how long it takes.",Robin
10259,You can not measure something like that in a while. It is step by step. From his bed at the front door. Bam! You're outside. Next!,Barney
10260,Hi.,Ted
10261,For me it's Ted.,Ted
10262,"I was left on the altar, there is one month.",Ted
10263,"It was a complete disaster and since then I have not even managed to look at another woman. Except the old lady in the subway that makes break dancing. I look at it that way. I just watched. Finally, it is an old lady who made the break dance.And it is good. I will give him a dollar, the next time. Let's pretend I said it: These travel lift were asleep the moment of my week, and I would like to see you Friday night. In a lift. At the restaurant, nice. What do you think?",Ted
10264,Sorry guys. I'll just make a fruit cup.,Lily
10265,It's been 12 minutes!,Marshall
10266,Put it!,Robin
10267,Ask your w*apon!,Robin
10268,You're who?,Ted
10269,"What are you doing, Mitch?",Ted
10270,"Robin did not use the super secret signal. We put the old menu on the handle. This restaurant had to close. Mr. Popol...No need to explain why it's funny. I'm off. When leaving, take the pillow with you. This is a waste now.",Ted
10271,"I think I am more than qualified for the job. My weaknesses? I would say too caring, overworked, and I spend my career first. Oops! The latter is true. What?",Robin
10272,"Apparently, our sweet, innocent, little Robin led a lover. A young skinny named Mitch.",Ted
10273,His thing arranged? A real disaster. She sent me text messages all night. She just let go to use the bathroom.,Lily
10274,Excuse me one minute.,Ted
10275,What action?,Ted
10276,&quot;The guy naked?&quot;,Ted
10277,"The bathroom is. (His phone rings) You know what, I will respond.",Robin
10278,No chance it works!,Ted
10279,Two out of three?,Ted
10280,How do you know?,Ted
10281,I'd rather not.,Ted
10282,It does not work really.,Ted
10283,No December '.,Marshall
10284,Two out of three. He assured me.,Ted
10285,"Seriously. No chance it works on Robin. It will come, take a look at this idiot and send tampers.",Barney
10286,"She'll b*at him up, yes.",Lily
10287,It's going to take his g*n and sh**t him.,Marshall
10288,My God!,Marshall
10289,It worked.,Ted
10290,The business returns for Mr. Popol.,Marshall
10291,&quot;The naked guy&quot; works! It will revolutionize the blows of an evening! It's like the forward pass in American football.Dunk the basketball. This stuff barber where they hold the wick and cut above. It changes everything!,Barney
10292,"Barney, this guy has slept with Robin, you say that being in love. How it makes you excited?",Lily
10293,"&quot;The naked guy&quot; is more important than me and Robin. All these years, I broke my ass, with my secret identity, my laps and my gadgets. I mean, I'm Batman. But this guy is Superman. He tears his clothes and go.",Barney
10294,What kind of gadgets you talking about?,Lily
10295,"So, it's going to be, a roommate? I come home, and guys with whom you will go out sitting on the couch, naked.",Ted
10296,I can not tell you.,Robin
10297,I can not believe that &quot;The guy with hair 'market has on you.,Ted
10298,"How do you say? I entered and he was naked. It was funny. I laughed, he laughed. And then it happened. I know not.",Robin
10299,I say ***** s!,Marshall
10300,Sorry?,Robin
10301,"Sorry Robin, but cate with this type suggests that all that separates you from sex, it's the clothes.",Marshall
10302,I have not slept with Mitch because he was naked.,Robin
10303,"So, why did you lie?",Marshall
10304,Because... It... It... because I like Mitch. Much. There was a... connection specificity. Specificity and feelings.,Robin
10305,"Because he was naked. Sorry, but I disagree. There is only one reason to sleep with someone, and it is &quot;love&quot;.Marshall is a big girl because he believes in love and read &quot;And it was true&quot; because the secretaries were forced to join the Oprah book club. But you know I'm right.",Marshall
10306,"Marshall, I love you, but there are plenty of reasons to lie.",Lily
10307,Cite me one.,Marshall
10308,I will quote 50.,Lily
10309,You could not.,Marshall
10310,Number one: last Thursday.,Lily
10311,"Marshall, you wanna do?",Lily
10312,I'm here.,Marshall
10313,You have defiled the marital bed because you could not sleep?,Marshall
10314,"It was you who said, &quot;This shadow on the ceiling, it looks an awful clown toothless. Good night, Lily. &quot;",Lily
10315,Okay! It makes one. But I dare you to...,Marshall
10316,"I'll give you 50. There's sex reconciliation... breaking sex, and sex &quot;a friend told you about a new position.&quot;",Lily
10317,"You're welcome. There is also &quot;revenge&quot;, &quot;bounce back&quot;, &quot;parachuting&quot;. When you're traveling, but instead of going to the hotel, you'll live in a bar to find a girl to get a foothold.",Barney
10318,"Oh, that, &quot;the kiss for a roof.&quot;",Robin
10319,***** S!,Marshall
10320,I do not. My roommate in college did.,Robin
10321,"No, Robin, it's just a bad cough. I'm not really a bad cough. We all know that the &quot;roommate in college,&quot; it's you, ***** s! Nobody has a Strepsil?",Marshall
10322,"Oh, I have one. Sex &quot;bugger all on TV.&quot;",Lily
10323,The sex &quot;hotel room&quot;.,Ted
10324,"&quot;Curiosity,&quot; style, &quot;Me have always wondered how to do this is with a great girl.&quot; Big guy not a girl, just great. Like...if a normal girl was 2.10 m, 2.25 m high, and... wearing a mini denim skirt. I wonder how it is.",Barney

10333,Thanks for ruining the memory of the anniversary of our six months.,Marshall
10334,You gave me some chips.,Lily
10335,You can stop with this stupid list? You make me sad.,Marshall
10336,"No, I have fun. But this thing of a &quot;partner&quot;, it sucks sometimes. I always talk about you. I can not play &quot;I never,&quot; because everyone knows all the quirks that I let you do.",Lily
10337,The only oddity that I did was to open my heart and my soul when I had put me to hair when the room was empty.,Marshall
10338,I have not slept with Mitch because he was naked!Mitch and I have something special. My fingers are crossed.That may be correct.,Robin
10339,The good? Mitch? The guy naked?,Marshall
10340,"You mean the naked genius. All this time I wore a suit when I should have removed it. That's it. I &quot;The guy naked,&quot; tonight. And you too.",Barney
10341,What?,Ted
10342,With the girl from the elevator. You're with her tonight?&quot;Dude naked&quot;!,Barney

10351,I'm stuck. I find it the last 2.,Lily
10352,"Reason 48: &quot;To reinforce good behavior, such as shaving or dental hygiene.&quot; Now you conditioned me? Great!That's why I have an erection when I go floss.",Marshall

10608,Really? You're like &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic to write that song on how to jump my sister.,Ted

10640,"It is about a girl who got caught for stealing, eight months ago.",Ted
10641,"Ted, many women have a period kleptomaniac. And yes, maybe sometimes they happen to mow a small object because it excites them in a strange way they are not explained. But...

10655,Why?,Ted
10656,I have a secret. No! It has not happened. It happened something.,Lily
10657,It's been what?,Ted

10684,"Yes. For example, everyone, how many Canadians does it take to change a lightbulb? &quot;What? No, the bulb is dead? I'm afraid! &quot;",Marshall
10685,This is stupid. Why do you think Canadians are afraid of the dark?,Robin
10686,"Where do prejudices? A stereotype appears, and suddenly, it spreads like fire. Asians misbehave, the Scots are stingy, the Brazilians are too many stamps. I doubt it works.You can not hang out with people who belittle your beloved country. I take you back.",Marshall
10687,"No, wait. I have something to say. Everyone. Let me tell you something about Canadians.",Robin
10688,"Please, no scene.",Marshall

10696,You know what? It's a new batch of old coasters. I will confirm with the bartender.,Lily
10697,Come on. Lily saw you.,Ted
10698,Oh yeah?,Barney
10699,"You see, Ted, you have so little faith in me and Heather...",Barney
10700,And as we can count on Lily to sneak.,Barney
10701,My God!,Lily
10702,What? Why do this?,Ted
10703,"Ted, you know, I'm not a saint. And yes, it is true that the times I drove your mother at the airport, say that there has been a... sexually confused and confusing time in the parking lot, but I said I draguerai not your sister, and I thought. You should have me believe.",Barney
10704,"Your mother and I, we kissed.",Barney
10705,You can catch two fish with a hook.,Marshall
10706,"No, but I can catch a fish and use this one to catch the other.",Robin

10710,Rashad Tarkenton.,Robin
10711,Gary Anderson. He is retired. It was a case of fly fishing... in Canada.,Marshall
10712,"You know what? I'm glad you know it because I am proud to be Canadian. It was not a good NFL team or Prince, but we invented Trivial Pursuit. Anything, the Earth! In addition, in Canada, you can go to a strip club full of alcohol and order. And yeah. Moosejaw in the Bay of Fundy, you can whistle your pint of Pilsner while watching a minor girl to get naked. Jealous? In Canada, people do not care where you come from, as you are whisked away nice and possibly a cigarette, or when a donut. I am proud to come from the &quot;Great White North&quot;... and I want to be right now. And was not afraid of the dark. Finally, we do not really like, but like everyone else.",Robin
10713,Merry Christmas. Look into it. If you push around the...Not down the middle.,Ted
10714,Got it.,Ted
10715,You know why?,Ted
10716,I want to know you. The new you.,Ted
10717,"By the way, in your new neighborhood, you should put a good lock on your door. If you want... live.",Ted
10718,Sorry about what happened inside. I was stupid. I should say anything.,Marshall
10719,"I'm sorry. That was your cue. I should not have my own.But every year during the holidays, I am homesick. And so far, every year, I had a reason to stay: a boyfriend, a job or something. But... This year, for the first time, I have nothing.",Robin
10720,But if.,Marshall
10721,What?,Robin
10722,"We love you all. If you ever leave again in Canada, we jump on a plane, you are pursuing, and after that Barney has dragged some of the club with which you have spoken, we will bring you here where you are supposed to be. This is not New York without Robin Scherbatsky.",Marshall
10723,Thank you.,Robin
10724,Yeah.,Marshall
10725,I miss sometimes. I wish I could close my eyes and find myself one hour in Canada.,Robin
10726,I was hoping that you say that.,Marshall
10727,How did you find this place?,Robin
10728,"Just like home, eh?",Marshall
10729,There's only one way to know.,Robin
10730,It's OK.,Robin
10731,thank you.,Robin
10732,"OK. You come home in him, he apologized and you file a donut free?",Marshall
10733,It's like home.,Robin
10734,Sorry! All is well! Sorry.,Marshall
10735,No one likes the dark.,Robin
10736,You were a member? You sing what?,Robin

10738,It looks good. I'll do.,Ted

10740,I saw in the fridge.,Ted
10741,empty.,Robin
10742,"So, throw it.",Ted
10743,The trash can is full.,Robin
10744,"So, take out the trash.",Ted
10745,I eat cereal.,Robin
10746,"You know, when I asked you to be my roommate, I said, &quot;A girl, she will be careful.&quot; But no, you're an ogre Revenge of the Nerds.",Ted
10747,"You know what? Instead of coming with references typical last minute like that, you should spend some time, I dunno... washing a dish.",Robin
10748,"Damn, I can not. I'm busy leave a plate of cookies for the elf magic puts toilet paper. Wait, there's no elf. It's always me!",Ted
10749,"I always changing. You, never!",Robin
10750,This is ridiculous!,Ted
10751,"No, I went there yesterday... Stop it! Stop it! My God, what happens? When we were a couple, we lived together and we almost went insane.",Robin
10752,I know. It's been what?,Ted
10753,You know what this is? We made love. Men and women need sex to live together. It resolves all disputes.,Robin
10754,As Barney's theory on world peace?,Ted
10755,"I explained. I said, Madeline, every international conflict essentially boils down to sexual tension.",Barney
10756,All international conflicts?,Ted
10757,"All, man.",Barney
10758,"So, the crisis in the Middle East could be solved by...",Ted
10759,Gaza Strippers. Next.,Barney

10763,"&quot;Mrs. Gorbachev, removed her underwear.&quot;",Barney
10764,"Well, I think we should love again.",Ted
10765,"Yes, of course.",Robin
10766,"I know. It's like riding a bike, man?",Robin
10767,"Biking upside down. Well, listen. If it should happen on occasion, they say nothing to anyone. Sold.",Ted
10768,Sold.,Robin
10769,Sold.,Marshall
10770,"You do not care what, guys? You are back together?",Marshall
10771,No. It was just love to do more fighting.,Ted
10772,"It's a great idea. No, really. Hat guys. I saw in the future and everything works perfectly for everyone.",Marshall
10773,Why are you here anyway?,Robin
10774,I was working and I had to take a leap here...reading this magazine. In... the room there.,Marshall
10775,I understand. No problem.,Ted
10776,"If this is a problem. You've done all the way here to read a magazine? I am willing to bet that there is a place to read this magazine at work. You know, a room with a little man on the door?",Robin
10777,"Well, Robin. Nobody likes reading a magazine at work. You leave your office holding a magazine...",Marshall
10778,... and the magazine says one thing and no one.,Marshall
10779,Have you thought about maybe not reading a magazine when you read a magazine?,Robin
10780,You have to read a magazine. That's why there has magazines.,Marshall
10781,"So, this is wasted time.",Ted
10782,"Exactly. And the worst part is, this piece of my hallway door to the toilet. It's exposure to criticism.",Marshall
10783,It was my head.,Marshall
10784,The boss.,Marshall
10785,"Anyway, I'd rather do it here.",Marshall
10786,"No, I'm sorry. This is our house now. Marshall, you should also read a magazine. Give me your key.",Robin
10787,"No, certainly not. Reminds me of a bargain between three parties where no one would discuss a certain event happened. An event... persuasion. This key, madam, this is my silence. Good day to you both.",Marshall
10788,You slept together?,Lily
10789,"Thank you, Lily.",Marshall
10790,"You... have slept together. What are Ã©pouv...stouflant. Epouvstouflant. Well done, Ted. Bravo.",Barney
10791,It seems more important than it is.,Robin
10792,We talked and we realized we had some difficult months.It deserves a little fun.,Ted
10793,"No. It could ruin your friendship. When two former try the &quot;right opportunity&quot;, someone always ends in pain.",Lily
10794,"We will not get there, OK? Nobody will get hurt. It has established rules.",Robin
10795,Rule number one: purely physical relationship. There are no feelings.,Ted
10796,This is like telling Fonzie be cool.,Robin
10797,"And since it's just physical, it was not to worry love.",Ted
10798,You can do it watching TV!,Robin
10799,Absolutely! Let's multitasking. Use sex to spice up the boring activities.,Ted
10800,As folding laundry.,Robin
10801,Paying the bills.,Ted
10802,It's not very hygienic.,Ted
10803,"Yes, not that one.",Robin
10804,"And now they sleep together, we argue more.",Robin
10805,"Problem solved. In fact, the credit goes to Barney. This idea just your thing on the world peace.",Ted
10806,"Yes. Thank you, Barney. You were right. Peace was established. More than once.",Robin
10807,"So, I am responsible for... Excellent. Excellent.Excellent. The next tour is for me!",Barney
10808,Are you okay?,Lily
10809,Yes. Why you ask?,Barney
10810,"For one thing, you cry openly.",Lily
10811,From joy. I am so happy for them.,Barney
10812,"Barney, admit it. You always have feelings for Robin and it tortures you.",Lily
10813,"I'm going quite well. Excuse me just a minute. (He goes out into the alley behind the bar, takes a television in a trash can and throws it down. Then back to talk to Lily) I'm going quite well.",Barney
10814,You must learn to express your feelings. Perhaps you should see a psychiatrist.,Lily
10815,"Wait. If I pay a woman $ 200 an hour to feel better, it will not discuss. And there will be both on the couch. The woman in my scenario, she is a prostitute. Dirty, vulgar, all redone, from Eastern Europe...",Barney
10816,I entered.,Lily
10817,There's something liberating not to take it seriously.,Ted
10818,Last night we did when I answered the phone.,Robin
10819,I knew you had not of paddler!,Marshall
10820,"Wonderful, we still speak of that!",Barney
10821,"Look, it's a private thing between me and Ted.",Robin
10822,It is not even discuss it if Marshall could read a magazine at work.,Robin
10823,"It was always like that. You remember, in law?",Lily
10824,Sure.,Marshall
10825,Baby? What has he?,Marshall
10826,"The bank statement arrived today. You have booked a hotel two blocks from your school, a Tuesday.",Lily
10827,That's not what you think.,Marshall
10828,"It's that, Marshall? What's her name?",Lily
10829,Burrito. Carnitas Burrito.,Marshall
10830,Have you booked a hotel room just to read a magazine?,Robin
10831,You do not want me to see if the waitress at a huge scale for this haughty tone with you? Nobody likes reading a magazine at work and they say they are not human.,Marshall
10832,"Dude, I read a magazine at work every day. I will not say how many meetings where I was late because I 'was reading a magazine. &quot; But I'm not ashamed of that. This is my moment. Sure, &quot;magazine is read&quot; is not sexy, but you know, this is something I have to do. Why be ashamed? Wait, &quot;read a magazine&quot; that's wank, right?",Barney
10833,I think so. You still have drank all my milk!,Ted
10834,We can make love.,Robin
10835,OK.,Ted
10836,"This is the ideal plan. Each time you start to yell, he lieth in place. One minute you're on the back of each other, and the one after that, well, the same thing.",Ted
10837,Super.,Barney
10838,"This morning, she cried through the door, &quot;You're too long in the shower! &quot;. A second later, she joined me. There, it has not bothered me to take my time.",Ted
10839,If great.,Barney
10840,"Sorry for the delay. I was typing a Scherbatsky. She used all my stamps, so in short, the postman rang twice. Should you stamp it!",Ted
10841,It's... just... if... Excuse me one second.,Barney
10842,"So, plasmas are better in low light, but the LCD is best to play?",Barney
10843,So if I want a very good contrast ratio...,Barney
10844,I take the CRT.,Barney
10845,"Barney, it's crazy.",Lily
10846,"I'm fine, thank you.",Barney
10847,"No, it's wrong. You must learn to get it out. As we did in my kindergarten class. &quot;The time for emotions&quot;, every Tuesday morning.",Lily
10848,"Look, maybe your kids resent their friends sleep together, but not me. I have never been better.",Barney
10849,Hello.,Ted
10850,Hello.,Robin
10851,It was fun last night.,Ted
10852,"Sure, it was a good one. Personal memo: leave it lying around the pizza box more often.",Robin
10853,"Okay, see you later.",Ted
10854,"Last night, Robin left a pizza box lying on the floor, so we had sex three times.",Ted
10855,OK.,Marshall
10856,And this morning before leaving for work... we kissed.,Ted
10857,Bizarre. It's weird.,Marshall
10858,What? This kiss has violated the spirit of our arrangement. She probably thinks that I have feelings for her.,Ted
10859,Do you have any?,Marshall
10860,"Yes, I love it. That's what... It's you, man.",Barney
10861,No. It meant nothing. It was just a reflex when we were a couple. But I did everything go wrong.,Ted
10862,Clearly. This is the end.,Barney
10863,Wait. Maybe she has not found it weird.,Marshall
10864,"It was weird. Bizarre, weird, weird. B-I-R-A-Z-R-E.Bizarre.",Robin
10865,That's not how it is written.,Lily
10866,"Come on, Lily. Do not your Ted.",Robin
10867,"I warned you. When ex relapse, ultimately, it hurts someone. But nobody is listening. This is the story of my life.My nice face that prevents people listen to my message.",Lily
10868,What do I do?,Robin
10869,"A single solution. You must stop sleeping together, please.",Barney
10870,"I think we should stop sleeping. Ted and I, it's like cigarettes. You take one into thinking it is good. And very quickly, you buy one carton per week. I must stop it.",Robin
10871,I have to stop it.,Ted
10872,"So, you stop that, huh?",Robin
10873,I think so.,Ted
10874,"This is for the best. It was fun, but I do not want it becoming weird.",Robin
10875,I do not either.,Ted
10876,Colocs?,Robin
10877,Colocs.,Ted
10878,But they say nothing to anyone. Okay?,Ted
10879,Sold.,Robin
10880,Sold.,Marshall
10881,Dude!,Robin
10882,Seriously!,Ted
10883,What is your problem?,Lily
10884,It did not last long.,Ted
10885,"Actually, what you did not care for us? I thought you had the perfect plan.",Robin
10886,That was the case.,Marshall
10887,"Everything was going well. I felt more and more comfortable, more confident. I could conquer the world. One morning I'm in the eighth with a magazine.",Marshall
10888,The celebrities extend their clothes? I also extend my machine. (The man breaks the wall of the toilet where Marshall is located) Do not enter!,Marshall
10889,It did not last long.,Marshall
10890,Thank you.,Barney
10891,What are you doing?,Ted
10892,"Because of your bickering roommates are always a source of conflict between you two, I wanted to help. In fact, I went to the post. I took you stamps. In about 10 000. That should be enough.",Barney
10893,"Thanks, I guess. You want a beer?",Ted
10894,I took it in passing. It's nothing.,Barney
10895,You have bought us a dishwasher?,Ted
10896,It has always been there. You've been here how long?,Barney
10897,"So you take it all and you can avoid to argue, eh?",Ted
10898,Exactly. I worry about you.,Barney
10899,"It bothers you that we sleep together, right?",Ted
10900,Not at all. It's crazy. What?,Barney
10901,You're in love with Robin? You're in love with Robin.That's why you not want people sleeping together.,Ted
10902,What? You say anything. A friend can not clean the apartment of another friend like friends do?,Barney
10903,Cite me a buddy in the story of friends who has already done that.,Ted
10904,I give you two: Clean and gentlemen Solcarlus.,Barney
10905,That thing between me and Robin is completely innocent.I flipperai if you tell me not feel something for her. This is the case?,Ted
10906,"No. This is not true, no. This is not true, no. No. Robin is all yours, man. Exploding yourself with it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go sleep with other girls.",Barney
10907,Are you sure?,Ted
10908,Yes!,Barney
10909,Positive?,Ted
10910,Absolutely. (Barney out of the apartment),Barney
10911,"And I went with a bang. Why did I do that? It comes perhaps my father issues, but... basically, I allowed my best friend to sleep with the girl of my dreams. I completely sabotaged. And now, I smoke. I smoke.",Barney
10912,Get out of here.,Lily
10913,"But it's time and emotions I Emotive, bears sharing.Whoever Emotive, Bear's shares, can sit on the chair of the division.",Barney
10914,"Barney, you're not at your therapist. These children also have their problems, you know. Ben's parents divorced.",Lily
10915,Who wants to do the coloring?,Lily
10916,"Great, it's Lily who sent you? I have not the bear, OK?I will make it! Why are you smiling?",Barney
10917,I just... reading a magazine. Here at work.,Marshall
10918,What?,Barney
10919,"It's the funniest thing. I was on the net, looking at hotels when I realized something.",Marshall
10920,This is stupid.,Marshall
10921,"I decided it was time to face my complex and do what I had to do and once that decision, everything changed.",Marshall
10922,"You're right, Super Babe Are My Woman Stop telling me Why You Are Not Famous But I stop To forget. Let's do it.",Marshall
10923,Congratulations.,Barney
10924,Thank you. I would have done well at some point.Sometimes you have to... You have to say and... go there.,Marshall
10925,"Marshall, I gotta go. In fact, there are toilets here, if you want to use.",Barney
10926,... Species,Marshall
10927,"Ted, I must tell you the truth. I love... (Robin out the trash) tacos. What are you doing?",Barney
10928,"I go step-louse. If you are looking for Ted, he was released. And... our little arrangement is... completed, by the way.",Robin
10929,Really? That's Wife... vantable.,Barney
10930,Epousvantable?,Robin
10931,"Yes, it is Ã©pousvantable. What has happened?",Barney
10932,He insisted. He said &quot;no longer able to do&quot; if &quot;it hurt someone.&quot; I think we all know who he is talking about.,Robin
10933,Oh?,Barney
10934,It's not obvious?,Robin
10935,It is?,Barney
10936,Yes. This is Ted. You know how it romantic. He can not separate the physical emotion. It is kind of...,Robin
10937,I love you.,Barney
10938,"Right. It's not like you, you know? In addition, we are friends. I want to complicate matters by committing. Hanging out with friends never works. So... you want to go eat a taco?",Robin
10939,A Taco?,Barney
10940,"You love them, right?",Robin
10941,Just.,Barney
10942,"Come on, I'm hungry.",Robin

10946,"Actually, no!",Marshall
10947,I do not either. I was hoping that you find.,Lily
10948,I will not get it.,Marshall
10949,What?,Ted
10950,Lily not want me to take a taxi to the airport just to get a taxi in the opposite direction.,Marshall
10951,But the thing of the pack?,Ted
10952,"It was fun when we were younger, but we exceeded it. When mature, the relationship matures with us.",Marshall
10953,"But... you are an inspiration to us all, you are so dedicated and linked. I look at you, and that's all I want in the world.",Ted
10954,"There are two students out, and they look easy!",Barney
10955,Arizona... You know... I always wanted to see what looks like a license in Arizona.,Ted
10956,I already did that. 21 years.,Barney
10957,It's good. God thank you. What brings you here?,Ted
10958,You have a group? We will perhaps see you.,Ted
10959,Excuse me one second. (Barney leads Ted to the bar entrance) What is your problem? We will not see them play.,Barney
10960,Why?,Ted
10961,"If you go see them, it is not better than blondes showing their tits at a concert by Van Halen.",Barney
10962,"Yes, but these girls they sleep with Van Halen after?",Ted
10963,"If you want to sleep with Van Halen, do it on your spare time. We're not guys who-could-come-you-see. It is the other guys, those older, who ever came and whose recognition is required.",Barney
10964,We are their fathers?,Ted
10965,"Exactly. (They go see the girls) This is a great meeting, I think that we can come. Another time, girls.",Barney
10966,"If you want to see us afterwards, we can exchange our numbers.",Ted
10967,Excuse us a minute. (Barney leads Ted still at the entrance of the bar) Have you gone crazy? We do not want their numbers.,Barney
10968,I know not what I was doing. I had panic there.,Ted
10969,"Qua na you exchange a number, you give him the opportunity to call to cancel. If you give a number without an appointment, they must come. Checkmate! No number, just my fingers. Truck.",Barney
10970,You're still their father?,Ted
10971,Why not arrange to meet you here tomorrow night to 22h.,Barney
10972,"Whatever happens, we will be there.",Barney
10973,That's all &quot;ski&quot; account.,Ted
10974,Sorry one last time.,Barney
10975,What is the problem here?,Ted
10976,Well done.,Barney
10977,Thank you.,Ted
10978,At tomorrow night.,Barney
10979,"'Definitely. Great! &quot;Dude, these students seem stupid.",Barney
10980,Bluntly.,Ted
10981,"Awesome. Here's the thing: tomorrow night, dress up well, it will move!",Barney
10982,We would still have had to make their numbers.,Ted
10983,"You always imagine the worst. Ted, I promise, everything will be okay. It begins to snow.",Barney
10984,It's really bad outside. They will not.,Ted
10985,"But if it will come. It has to. If I can touch one of those girls, I get a &quot;Bingo party student.&quot; Come on, Ted. You're the only one here.",Barney
10986,"Sorry, a &quot;Bingo party student&quot;?",Ted
10987,"Every year, Playboy publishes a list of the best student parties in the country. I take the top 25, and I do... a bingo card. All I need now that Arizona Tech, which is crazy. In a contest, it would be given automatically.",Barney
10988,How many people are on this festive bingo student?,Ted
10989,Just me.,Barney

10991,The goal is to make it five in a row.,Barney
10992,"And you got what, if you succeed?",Ted

10994,Thanks for stopping by. I hacked the thermostat for 1 h before it was seen that the intercom.,Robin
10995,"Yeah, I heard you moan from below.",Marshall
10996,"The theft of Lily's tonight, you're really not looking for it?",Robin
10997,"As I said, when you grow up, our relationship matures with us.",Marshall
10998,"Knowing your wife, she'll still bring you back a pack.",Robin
10999,Marshall?,Lily
11000,What are you doing?,Robin
11001,I'm going to the airport. How could I be so stupid? Of course it takes me back a pack!,Marshall
11002,"But this time, I'm not back pack. Because... when it matures, the relationship matures with us.",Lily
11003,Where is my beer?,Marshall

11017,Our bar would be great.,Ted
11018,"And dude, dude, dude, dude... The name of our bar will be... Puzzles. People will, &quot;Why Puzzles? &quot;That's the puzzle.",Barney
11019,"That's... a great name for a bar! And also, Puzzles: no nightcap.",Ted

11026,You? Great! I'm coming. (She hangs up his phone) Ranjit?,Lily

11037,"Prem's, prem's prem's.",Barney
11038,"I guess you could stay open longer. As it is you and the group? (The bar is crowded) Melissa, what kind of group is it?",Ted
11039,"Dude, Carl is going to k*ll us if we turn not everyone immediately. I'm serious. He promised not to mess. Okay, you score a point. The bar is open! Who wants a beer?",Ted
11040,"I always find it silly. What happened to &quot;when you grow up, the relationship matures with us&quot;?",Robin
11041,"It's just something Lily read in &quot;Psychology.&quot; It's good, she read in &quot;Cosmo&quot;. Okay, I read in &quot;Cosmo&quot;. Well, it was in &quot;Cosmo Girl&quot;. Drive, OK?",Marshall

11048,They f*ck like rabbits.,Marshall
11049,You know what I miss? The call for lunch.,Lily
11050,"Baby, it's lunch and I love you.",Lily
11051,"No, I love you even more.",Lily
11052,"Do we get a room to pull all this out? It seemed like a good compromise, although I have to work my positions. I love you too.",Marshall
11053,"Now, when she calls, I let the answering machine.The answering machine!",Marshall
11054,How dare you?,Robin
11055,What I miss most is the kiss of midnight New Year,Marshall
11056,It was New Year's tradition But you know what we did this year?,Lily
11057,No.,Lily
11058,"All of these little rituals, nice, cute... This is stupid. Say what we ate? They look like kids playing in the dinette.",Robin
11059,Maybe you think it's stupid because you've never had a relationship that lasts long enough for that.,Marshall
11060,What?,Robin
11061,You know nothing of love. You're like a robot that someone would cry and say that... &quot;Why this human leaking?&quot;,Marshall
11062,Really? Okay... Robot mode station-you-on-the-aisle-in-waiting-for-excuse-of-the imbecile.,Robin
11063,My robot was... a thousand times better.,Marshall
11064,There's no sink. And you get out of the kitchen.,Ted
11065,Is there anything in a gin and tonic? There's what in a gin and tonic?,Barney

11068,Last glass.,Barney
11069,A snowplow arrives. We must leave.,Marshall
11070,"You think being in love, it's just to have pet names. Or let the words stupid or darken in the blizzard for no reason.",Robin
11071,You know what will happen?,Marshall
11072,"You know what you are? You're a snob of love. There's lots of ways to live a relationship, you would know if you left your little club &quot;Snob love.&quot;",Robin
11073,"We'll be buried under the snow, that's what will happen.",Marshall
11074,Nothing to be done. I will not sit here and insult me.We're not going to the airport. We go. (The snowplow passes and buried under the snow) It's been what?,Robin
11075,It was earlier called for the drink of Seattle.,Lily
11076,"It is rather a hurry, so we'll take the beer.",Lily
11077,We're not a couple.,Lily
11078,No. It is a drum. I want a six pack.,Lily
11079,You take the barrel.,Lily
11080,"Sorry, Ranjit, but it is a ritual, and I back this beer. If you could put it in the car. I'll give you $ 50.",Lily
11081,"Robin, I'm sorry. You're not a robot. If you are, you are a very advanced model, and the human race has no chance. You did not choose to show your love through rituals tacky, and that's good. But maybe we did that because we have always done and we know no other way. What I know is that if there sitting alone at the airport, I have to go get her.These are the rules.",Marshall
11082,Close your eyes.,Robin
11083,"I know not how you thought I draguais you, but...",Marshall
11084,"Do it. (Robin opened the roof and the snow falls on them) Now, go find your wife.",Robin
11085,"Okay, go. You are not obliged to return, but you can not stay. I always wanted to say that. I mean, in a bar. I say all the time with me.",Barney
11086,We said no last drink. We must do.,Ted
11087,We should do what? Carl will be there from one moment to another.,Barney
11088,We can do one thing.,Ted
11089,"Caring for a bar, it's boring. We should stick to what we know.",Ted
11090,We should start a band.,Barney
11091,Of course! Why was not yet formed a band?,Ted
11092,Where is she?,Marshall
11093,Seattle.,Robin
11094,What?,Marshall
11095,His flight was canceled. He has never taken off.,Robin
11096,She would have called me and...,Marshall
11097,"Baby, it's me. My flight was canceled because of a snowstorm and I will not fly until Thursday, I'm still stuck here for two days. It's lunchtime and I love you.",Lily
11098,I still think it's stupid.,Robin
11099,"It not return until Thursday. It was all the way here and not return until Thursday. I feel stupid. Listen, they say nothing to Lily about everything, OK? Especially the part where thou dredges.",Marshall
11100,I've not dredged.,Robin
11101,That's it.,Marshall
11102,"Dude, I do not believe that you've ever done this far.You'll have to go back and redo all that way again tomorrow.",Ted
11103,The whole thing was a sign. Let us end this ancient ritual. I will not get it.,Marshall
11104,Robin you really dredged?,Ted
11105,"Dude, that was weird.",Marshall
11106,The flute section does she see anyone?,Barney
11107,You're not really looking for it?,Ted
11108,Really.,Marshall
11109,"So, on New Year's kiss, calls for lunch, all... &quot;I ate it today,&quot; you're really going to drop it?",Ted
11110,"Yes, really.",Marshall
11111,"A muffin, a pastrami sandwich, and chips. I know that lunch is over, but I love you. I love you Lily, more and more each day. Happy New Year. That means I have to bring a band at the airport now?",Marshall
11112,Yes.,Lily
11113,Damn.,Marshall
11114,Puzzles.,Ted
11115,Bingo!,Barney
11116,It's crazy that Metro News One sends you this letter now.,Marshall
11117,"Yes, I went for 4 months.",Robin
11118,You got more fans than I thought.,Lily
11119,And only 60% of them are prisoners.,Ted
11120,"These guys think what? I am far from my phase &quot;dating a prisoner.&quot; It's like: &quot;Hi, I am over 19 years.&quot;",Robin
11121,The daughter of the lottery is there.,Barney
11122,I'm sorry for these women. This is where careers go to die on TV.,Robin
11123,Look. It's funny. I invented a little game,Barney

11129,What happens after that is out of the jacuzzi. Great?,Barney
11130,Hi.,Robin
11131,How was the audition?,Lily
11132,I went very confident. I knew it was just me against two other girls.,Robin
11133,I listening.,Barney
11134,Hello.,Robin

11136,I was a presenter here for Metro News One.,Robin

11139,"Mine: &quot;From all of us in Barney's apartment, get out.&quot;",Barney
11140,"You do not let these bitches destabilize you, right?",Lily
11141,"... and the president's economic team hopes to have a proposal before Congress by the end of the month. All of us at News 10, have a great evening. So, good night, New York.And that the road ahead is illuminated in dreams and tomorrows. Which are lit with dreams... also.",Robin
11142,It's terrible. And bad... also.,Ted

11145,Leave covered?,Marshall
11146,"I will not be a presenter at Channel 10, right?",Robin

11151,Dr. X? You always talk to Dr. X?,Lily
11152,Who is Dr. X?,Robin
11153,No one knows. It was a mysterious and awesome DJ.,Ted
11154,It was Ted.,Marshall
11155,His identity is still secret.,Ted
11156,It was Ted.,Lily
11157,But this phantom waves changed the face of the campus radio.,Ted
11158,It was Ted.,Marshall

11171,No. We will not let them. One of us will help you find.,Ted
11172,"Yes, I'm sure I can find you something at school.",Lily
11173,"No, guys... it does not work like that. Robin will have its license if it works in his field. You could stay if you got married to a U.S. citizen. Yes, it might work. No. The procedure to formalize it would take too much time. It will not work.",Marshall
11174,I'm screwed. I send my demo for 3 months and nothing.,Robin
11175,"Maybe there is something in it that people do not like.We'll watch it, OK?",Ted
11176,"Good question, Norm. For the first, I was an intern for Channel 22 in Red Deer. Alberta. In Canada. The snow falls hard enough, but these intrepid fishermen are still happy to contribute to the gathering of bass fishing Lake Athabasca, a tradition of 1 August To you, Norm. What? It was my first job. It shows where I come from.",Robin
11177,"Unless a bear attacks you in 3 seconds with your legs and you break his neck, it has nothing to do in your demo.",Barney
11178,"No, no, I understand. Your origins are part of what you sell. Moreover, in 'Special jurisdiction' on my resume, I put that in Minnesota, I was dunk champion Nicollet County in 1995.",Marshall
11179,You've put champion dunk in your CV?,Ted
11180,"Yes, why not? Many companies have a basketball team. They like that TonnerreVanille can still crash into the net.",Marshall
11181,We called you TonnerreVanille?,Robin
11182,"Yeah, TonnerreVanille. The ghost of snowshoes.The gate man. I was not very good in defense.",Marshall

11191,"Tell me, other girls in your class have the dancer's hip?",Robin
11192,Sure.,Marshall
11193,I have a technical question. Is it easier to dance when you do not have external genitalia?,Ted
11194,"Well, go ahead, feel free to me.",Marshall
11195,"Come on, guys. It did not hurt while dancing.",Lily
11196,"Thank you, Lily.",Marshall
11197,"Obviously, the stirrups were too far apart during his last visit to the gynecologist.",Lily
11198,"Folks, sorry to stop you before Marshall falls into tears, but Robin, check it out. What you need is a super video resume. Like mine.

11199,Is that you? You INTERVIEWED yourself?,Ted
11200,How could that be me? He is an Englishman. What would you recommend to your many admirers who want to reach the peak of their potential?,Barney
11201,And a little Scottish.,Ted
11202,"The first thing to know about success is that it will not come to you. Most people associate success with money and power, but in fact it is a mindset.",Barney

11204,"And when it comes to success, the only limit is that there is no limit.",Barney
11205,You know you stand next to a horse. Impressive.,Marshall
11206,"Barney, I do not understand. You doing anything in these clips.",Lily
11207,"Exactly. Because that's what the world wants to work.People who seem to take risks, but never do anything. In fact, you do things will turn. I write a book about this phenomenon.",Barney
11208,Really?,Marshall
11209,"No, it would be... You listen? All my life I have dared to go beyond the possible. Until the impossible? In fact, beyond that... where the possible and the impossible meet to become... the possimpossible.",Barney
11210,The possimpossible? Oh yeah?,Lily
11211,"Inventing your own word shows creativity and vision...&quot;Visia-ness.&quot; If I can leave you with one thought, is this one: nothing... and all... is possimpossible. (Several assembly passes with a song) This guy is awesome.",Barney
11212,It's you again...? You sing a song about you?,Ted

11232,Since I was little...,Robin

11234,How does make me feel stupid commit somewhere?,Robin
11235,"All right. Do not do it. There are many exciting stories to cover in Canada. I just read it, the nephew of the mayor of Winnipeg went fishing on the ice and took a pole of 7 Kg Live from the worst place in the world, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.",Barney

11246,You hurt the hip like that?,Lily
11247,"Super! Thank you, Herm.",Marshall
11248,"These clothes are ridiculous. In addition, the armor of the amazon princess itch.",Robin

11253,"There is more in 1950. Yes, you can.",Barney
11254,I'm off.,Robin

11319,Wait. Where are you going?,Lily
11320,Nowhere. At the beach. It's winter. Laser Tag. At home. Shut up! It is you who are going somewhere.,Barney
11321,My God. He goes to see now.,Lily
11322,Where is Barney?,Marshall
11323,Yeah. It is even more in Manhattan. Where does this girl?,Ted
11324,We talk about a woman that Barney Stinson has worked. I vote for Narnia.,Robin
11325,He stops.,Ted
11326,What are you doing here?,Barney
11327,Where is she?,Lily
11328,Who?,Barney
11329,"Your girlfriend. You did not really like, huh?",Lily
11330,"These are my friends. Ted, Marshall, Lily and Robin.Guys, here is Loretta. My mother.",Barney
11331,You call your mother every day?,Robin
11332,Mom!,Barney
11333,So that's what we hide you? You did not want people to know that you're a momma's boy.,Lily
11334,"Yes, you got me. I guess you can leave.",Barney
11335,Hi.,Robin
11336,"Ted, Marshall, Lily, Robin. I present to you Betty... my wife. And my son, Tyler.",Barney
11337,She wants me to live long.,Barney
11338,Me too.,Barney
11339,"Will in, little rascal! I'll see you at the bar?",Barney
11340,"What's that, Barney?",Robin
11341,"It's a long story. As you know, my father had to leave my mother when I was a baby because he became presenter of the Just Price.",Barney
11342,Very good program.,Robin
11343,Bob Barker is your father.,Marshall
11344,"She had to raise my brother and I, all alone. And his only wish was that his son did not end up alone like her. And there seven years, she fell ill.",Barney
11345,I do not think she was going to make. So I decided to fulfill his wish. Mom. This is Betty. We're engaged.,Barney
11346,I hired an actress to play my girlfriend &quot;Betty&quot;. His real name is Margaret. It is mainly small theaters. Superb actress.In it a Moliere. I say no more. This is political. I should not talk about it. But there is a problem. Betty has a slight tendency to improvise.,Barney
11347,"You see, Mom? I found someone who makes me happy. As you wished.",Barney
11348,"And then my mother went better. It was miraculous.But I had to keep &quot;Betty&quot; and make a casting to find my son, Tyler.",Barney
11349,It's crazy. Did you actually cast your own son?,Lily
11350,"For a while, it was enough to borrow / keep the baby from neighbors. And once at Christmas, my mother was drunk at the grog, I went out with a bag of flour and a Chucky mask.But eventually I had to audition.",Barney
11351,"four, eight... thirteen, you stay. The other, you can leave.",Barney
11352,Apparently I'm better actor than your son. Bring those from 11!,Barney
11353,And that's how the role of Tyler went to... Grant.,Barney
11354,"Come on, Grant looks pretty good.",Ted
11355,Really? Look. Tyler? Tyler? Tyler? Grant?,Barney
11356,"You see? This is amateur work. Believe me, the child stars had better possession in the 80s.",Barney
11357,It sounds like your mother kept your child's room as you had left.,Lily
11358,It's a huge Karate Kid poster above your bed.,Marshall
11359,"Karate Kid's a great movie. This is the story of a young karate enthusiast whose dreams led him to Karate Championship All Star Valley. Unfortunately, he loses in the final against another loser. But he learned an important lesson in accepting his defeat.",Barney
11360,"Wait. When you watch Karate Kid, you are the wicked little blonde?",Lily
11361,"No, I'm for the other loser from New Jersey who barely knows karate. When I watch Karate Kid, I'm for real karate kid: Johnny Lawrence of Cobra Kai dojo. Do not get dumber than you are, Lily.",Barney
11362,"I just remembered where I know you. I saw you play at the theater of disorientation, Die heilige Johanna der Schlachth&amp;ouml;fe by Bertolt Brecht, last fall. You were a revelation!",Ted
11363,Yes.,Ted
11364,Yes. Sorry. You got a Brechtophile before thee!,Ted
11365,"Mrs Theatre has won my heart once and has never left me. Every year at Christmas, I created a piece for parents with all the kids.",Ted
11366,"Cut! Cut! Grandpa and Grandma will be there in half an hour, and you always skinned my words. I feel like I'm going to write, direct and play this thing. Give me your elf hat. Sit down.",Ted
11367,I always wanted to be an actor. It is this kind of dream that flies away with time.,Ted
11368,Really?,Ted
11369,You do not like playing the son of Barney?,Robin
11370,"I know what it is. I am a presenter. But I had to accept a job on a morning show that starts at 4:30. I thought evolve much faster than that, you know? I'm almost 30 years.",Robin
11371,I have not had surgery.,Robin
11372,I can not believe that there has never met you. Who knew that Barney's mother was so great?,Lily
11373,Do not say that. I'm sure you were great.,Marshall
11374,I'm sorry?,Lily
11375,Barney Mom? Loretta.,Marshall
11376,"You must tell the truth to your mother, OK? Listen, this is a nice woman, loving, a little too direct that deserves better.",Marshall
11377,"No, no question. The truth would k*ll her.",Barney
11378,"I do not feel well to the idea of lying to a woman so warm, OK? It reminds me of my mother. What?",Marshall
11379,"Warm? Remember to marriage, I said we would be together forever? On our return down the aisle, your mother leaned over and said, &quot;Not forever, darling. Marshall will go to heaven. &quot;",Lily
11380,She was joking.,Marshall
11381,"She hates me, Marshall. But that's okay, because...Forget.",Lily
11382,You're going to say what?,Marshall
11383,Nothing. You want to go do it again in the bedroom of Barney?,Lily
11384,On the bed &quot;race car&quot;?,Barney
11385,"The handles are great. Listen, Lily, if you learned something today, is that honesty is important in a family.Whatever your feelings about my mother, we've been together for 12 years, baby. I think I can handle it.",Marshall
11386,Really? I hate your mother.,Lily
11387,You know what? I hate you!,Marshall
11388,We talked about it a million times! You get no slogan!,Barney
11389,I can make another cast. Will remember your sentences for the big dinner scene.,Barney
11390,Wait. You wrote that we will have dinner?,Robin
11391,Just a little script. Things that my mother will be pleased to hear.,Barney
11392,What kind?,Robin
11393,The nostrils dilated. They do it when she gets mad. I love it. As now. Like now!,Barney
11394,"Sorry, my little bear. Continues. You really like that for a relationship.",Barney
11395,"No, not at all.",Lily
11396,"Funny story, the other night, this little rascal had a nightmare. He came to tell us what it was, you remember what you said?",Barney
11397,Page 4...,Barney
11398,"Thank you very much, man. Tonight I will not sleep.",Marshall
11399,"Tyler said: &quot;In my nightmare, mom and you did not know how much I loved you. So I'm here to say it was great...like that. &quot;",Barney
11400,We're a happy family.,Barney
11401,No weak link in this scene. Bravo!,Barney
11402,"Come on, Barney. You have no idea of the difficulty of getting a job beneath you. I really liked your tip on the bones of dinosaurs.",Robin
11403,You can stop with that?,Marshall
11404,Go and eat your ice.,Barney
11405,Guess who is not lactose intolerant: Tyler. Tyler will go there and enjoy every bite.,Barney
11406,Yum!,Barney
11407,You're not gonna get us out a slogan.,Barney
11408,"I, yes. Follow me. I... been betrayed by my best friend.How could you do that, Ted? Think of the poor Tyler who tries valiantly to hold back tears. It's good my boy, you can cry.Weep!",Barney
11409,What can you have to say for yourself?,Barney
11410,"Is it I who betrayed, or that you have betrayed me?",Ted
11411,Sorry. What?,Barney
11412,"November 14, 1998. The night train to Monte Carlo. I was in the car pool arnaquant Algerians few thousand dinars, while thou sÃ©duisais my bride! Who is blind and took you for me.",Ted
11413,"For God's sake, what are you talking?",Barney
11414,You know not well what I mean?,Ted
11415,"No, not at all.",Barney
11416,"Of course I do! And for sure I'll hear you admit it, manure!",Ted
11417,"Mom, you leave us a moment?",Barney
11418,You've lost your mind?,Barney
11419,"Honestly, I played a really Ted, I tried not to be him.",Ted
11420,What's wrong with you? How do I explain this to my mother?,Barney
11421,It may be time to tell him the truth.,Lily
11422,"I know. Sometimes, honesty leads people to say bad things about the woman who always took care of me because I was the runt of the family. For God's sake, I'm just a 92 m!",Marshall
11423,"Perfect. You see? Even in a role that you hate, you manage to love what you do.",Robin
11424,You think so?,Robin
11425,"Thank you, Grant. You're pretty smart, you know that?",Robin
11426,"Mom, I've got something to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. Tyler is dying. And Betty said that when he is gone, it will go out. So it may soon be over.",Barney
11427,None of this is true! The truth is that... Betty and Tyler are actors I hired to pretend to be my family.,Barney
11428,"I just wanted you to think I had the life you wanted for me. I wanted you to be proud of me. It sounds crazy, and I'm sorry, Mom.",Barney
11429,No.,Barney
11430,Really?,Barney
11431,Is it not?,Barney
11432,"I know! They are not horrible? So really, you angry with me?",Barney
11433,Really?,Barney
11434,"I'm really relieved because in reality, I am also far from being a married man can be. My stories with women you would shock and horrify you.",Barney
11435,"Seriously, you can not imagine what I could do.",Barney
11436,Mom!,Barney
11437,The taxi is here.,Robin
11438,I'll try.,Barney
11439,"And I just wanted to say, if I was never cold or distant, I'm sorry.",Lily
11440,Who speaks it?,Robin
11441,My mother.,Marshall
11442,It mean a lot to me if we could be closer.,Lily
11443,I love you...,Lily
11444,Mom...,Ted
11445,... Mom.,Lily
11446,"Do like I was nice. I mean, it's really nice of you, Judy.You too. See you soon.",Lily
11447,"That I understand that. You tell me when you watch Karate Kid, you're not in San Daniel?",Marshall
11448,Nope!,Barney
11449,Who do you like in Die Hard?,Ted
11450,"Hans Gruber, the villain class. At the end, it is trapped.This is the title character.",Barney
11451,"OK, and Breakfast Club?",Lily
11452,The teacher who is watching. This is the only one who passes the whole movie in a suit.,Barney
11453,I have one. Terminator.,Robin
11454,"What is the title, Robin? Who among us has not shed a tear when his small red eye goes to the end and he can not k*ll these people? Sorry. The film...",Barney
11455,I'll watch the film again with you.,Ted
11456,They even try to help!,Barney
11457,"Hello, everyone.",Robin
11458,So you do really? You really gonna go to work at 2am.,Marshall
11459,I do not for me. I do it for the fans.,Robin
11460,Who is a fan of a program broadcast at 4am?,Marshall
11461,Those with a show at 5am?,Lily
11462,The addicts who have not sold their TV?,Ted
11463,The strippers in this weird time between work and waking the children?,Barney
11464,They are. Put me know. It's been what?,Robin
11465,"You know, as usual.",Marshall
11466,"Really, as usual.? Think the funniest thing that ever happened.",Barney
11467,It's good.,Robin
11468,And twice that.,Barney
11469,So a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos?,Robin
11470,Something even funnier happened to Marshall today.,Barney
11471,"First, nothing is funnier than that. Then it's not such a good story.",Marshall
11472,"Come on, guys. You are four young people active in the most exciting city in the world. And you have nothing to tell me?",Robin
11473,What do you want? Sometimes it's like that. The same thing over and over again. One of my students ate glue.,Lily
11474,I have used questionable methods to skip a very silly girl.,Barney
11475,"My ex, Karen, is in New York. The usual routine.",Ted
11476,Karen is here?,Lily
11477,You're kidding me!,Barney
11478,"My God, it was a real idiot.",Lily
11479,"Dude, the gold medal of the andouille de Vire.",Marshall
11480,It was not that bad.,Ted
11481,"Of course, for you. You had it turned into a zombie of andouille.",Lily
11482,"I want to eat your brain, but only if it is organic and free range.",Marshall
11483,What?,Ted
11484,You pass me the salt?,Lily
11485,Bluntly.,Ted
11486,It's... a TV.,Marshall
11487,Bluntly.,Ted
11488,Bluntly.,Ted
11489,This makeup has one month to go. I met with parents of Lily. I have never looked so stupid.,Marshall
11490,"So far. Tells the story, tells the story!",Barney
11491,Get off me!,Marshall
11492,Wait. It's really funny?,Robin
11493,"I'm not kidding. I almost do not want you to hear, because really, for the rest of your life, nothing will ever be as fun and you, curse you for agreeing to hear. You gotta hear it.This is too funny.",Barney
11494,Okay.,Marshall
11495,This morning I was in the gymnasium of the box to play basketball. The guys from work can be quite violent with their taunts.,Marshall
11496,I think that the knees are made to bend like that. He may have torn his cruciate ligament.,Marshall
11497,"I can be a bit watered down dialogue, whatever...",Marshall
11498,I searched my bag to get my stuff working...,Marshall
11499,Wait. Expect. I want to say.,Barney
11500,Okay. Say it.,Marshall
11501,"He searched his bag to get his stuff, and... No, say it.It's more fun if you say so. Let me say it. No, say it. You say.Say it. At the same time. No, go ahead.",Barney
11502,I forgot...,Marshall
11503,He forgot his pants!,Barney
11504,He forgot his pants.,Barney
11505,"He forgot his pants. It's pretty funny. Less than a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos. I mean, he... he forgot that he was already one? Moron, the monkey.",Robin
11506,"So, Karen in New York. Bizarre, no?",Ted
11507,You can not get back with Karen.,Lily
11508,I never said I'd do that. I thought it arrives. That would be the worst disaster if I called?,Ted
11509,"It is not the worst, no. That would be the fourth worst.1: Super volcano. 2: An asteroid falls to Earth. 3: Any record of Evel Knievel is lost. 4: Ted called Karen. 5: Lily is eaten by a shark.",Marshall
11510,"My name is Lily and I approve this order. You know the story. Ted and Karen had a rocky relationship in college. It always happened like this. They were having fun, being obnoxious until one day...",Lily
11511,"You find pepperoni fascist and you're so right, so... (He finds Karen in bed with another) Oh, my God! Karen!",Ted
11512,"After that, they broke. Ted was totally depressed, and we waited the necessary time to tell him what we thought of it.",Marshall
11513,I broke up with Karen.,Ted
11514,They hated it!,Lily
11515,"Bye bye, the slut!",Marshall
11516,Then Ted went up the noggin and took the bus to Providence to tell Karen's four truths.,Lily
11517,How was it?,Marshall
11518,Super. Look who's here!,Ted
11519,"And finally, all over again from scratch.",Lily
11520,"It's gonna be 10,002 Maniacs, because I have tickets to Natalie Merchant...",Ted
11521,"She came to see you in college and when you had my back turned, she brought the guys in your room?",Robin
11522,Respect.,Barney
11523,"I was an idiot. It was my first real girlfriend. I was crazy about her. We've all done things we regret in college. In the third year, Marshall has grown the goatee, wearing a beret and Rasta required to be called MJ Cool.",Ted
11524,I regret it at all.,Marshall
11525,So you really think that I should not call?,Ted
11526,No.,Robin
11527,Go back in your little head it.,Marshall
11528,"OK, OK. Interesting information: it is already done.",Ted
11529,Are you kidding!,Lily
11530,The pants!,Barney
11531,I can not believe that thou hast called. Why do not you invite him to lunch as you're at it?,Lily
11532,Because I will not invite him to lunch... again.,Ted
11533,You have to lunch?,Lily
11534,Why do you want to lunch with an ex?,Marshall
11535,"Good question, there are four reasons for a &quot;meal ex '.1: They want to get back together.",Barney
11536,"As my high school boyfriend, Scooter.",Lily
11537,"The Lilium, not stupid. Sorry, I have no scooter for you.",Lily
11538,It is this server?,Lily
11539,2: They want to k*ll you. As my lunch with Wendy.,Barney
11540,"But you did not do it, you've continued to insist.",Barney
11541,g*n! She's got a g*n!,Barney
11542,3: They make you really want your business.,Barney
11543,As my lunch with Curt.,Robin
11544,"My short-barreled 38 Special Police! I knew that I had left it somewhere. Every time I watch the news, I pray it is not my g*n.",Robin
11545,Or four: You taunt with their success.,Barney
11546,As my lunch with Nicole Barsamian.,Marshall
11547,Who is Nicole Barsamian?,Robin
11548,My ex.,Marshall
11549,"Hi, Nicole.",Marshall
11550,You look pretty.,Marshall
11551,Already? Who?,Marshall
11552,You must cancel the luncheon.,Marshall
11553,"I'd do that, of course... if he had not already occurred.",Ted
11554,"Robin, I will have to borrow the butt of your g*n.",Lily
11555,I still lost. You come to believe?,Robin
11556,How can you break bread with this chick?,Lily
11557,It was a lunch and not eat wheat. It was nice to be back.We even laughed at the idiots we were.,Ted
11558,Say I had a picture of Moliere on my backpack.,Ted
11559,Bluntly pretentious.,Ted
11560,"I hate change, but take us brushettes and fresh mozzarella. Grazie.",Ted
11561,It was great. There was an odd moment near the end.,Ted
11562,"How to say goodbye in these situations? A kiss on the cheek, too familiar. A handshake, too formal.",Robin
11563,And a hug is like a hug in public.,Barney
11564,You must embrace strangely.,Marshall
11565,What has happened?,Lily
11566,So...,Ted
11567,"Ted, darling. Go outside and bite the curb. I arrive in 1 minute.",Lily
11568,"Karen was the first girl I really loved. And after the year I had, I dunno, I think of lunch with her reminded me what it was to turn 18 and life ahead. And I would remind everyone that at least I was wearing pants.",Ted
11569,You can not change the subject like that.,Marshall
11570,The pants.,Robin
11571,The pants! The pants!,Barney
11572,"It was nothing! I had a small problem, so I called Lily.",Marshall
11573,"Tell us, what was this concern?",Barney
11574,I forgot my pants.,Marshall
11575,What do you mean you forgot your pants?,Lily
11576,I forgot. You have a bringest me.,Marshall
11577,And the spare.,Lily
11578,"Last Thursday, the mustard? You have a goldfish memory.",Marshall
11579,"Ted, you're not going out so easily. While the history of pants is fun...",Lily
11580,"Fun? Rather, very fun.",Barney
11581,That's nothing compared to this crazy thing with Karen.Ends.,Lily
11582,That's all. It was just a kiss in a restaurant.,Ted
11583,Why do you say &quot;the restaurant&quot;? You've embraced elsewhere?,Lily
11584,"As in a tree? No, it was not done in a tree. What is his problem?",Ted
11585,You did what?,Marshall
11586,How could you?,Barney
11587,"Marshall forgot his pants today, and yet you are the stupidest in this table.",Lily
11588,"Lily, let's be honest. We know both your motives. You hate Karen because she lingered.",Ted
11589,assh*le.,Lily
11590,What do you mean by linger?,Robin
11591,"February 5,... In 1998. I painted...",Lily
11592,"Ted Horn, critique my painting, anything, that's your business. But I catch you eyeing the mess of my guy and you lingered? You'll be received well.",Lily
11593,The game is the game,Robin
11594,"In his defense, I had just the muscle.",Marshall
11595,Why paint naked?,Ted
11596,"He had eaten my fruit bowl. The fact is that Karen is a dirty pervert, you can not bring into our lives.",Lily
11597,"Relax, it was just one night! And three after. And one morning. But at least I had pants. Even if, in fact, I had not.",Ted
11598,It happened to us? Where was I?,Robin
11599,You know the sleeping pills you take for your crazy schedule? They are stronger than you think.,Ted
11600,Do not worry. I will say nothing to Marshall.,Robin
11601,"Ted, that's for sure, it's fun to look back when you were a farm girl fresh complexion and a virgin. But all that stuff... Ohio, Karen, in college... it was A.S. &quot;Before Stinson.&quot; Now your life is great! Okay, you still live with your ex, which is ridiculous. Laser tag your k*ll are almost nonexistent. And your wardrobe, it's like, what, you're allergic to fabric quality?Seriously, pull yourself together. What are we talking?",Barney
11602,What is the result with the bimbo?,Robin
11603,"It's a foregone conclusion. Ted is Charlie Brown trying to sh**t and Karen, it's Lucy who takes away the ball at the last second and sleeping with. You have understood me.Ted falls in love, and Karen is going wrong with a playboy, who says... &quot;Sorry, dude.&quot;",Marshall
11604,"False! You got to let the right answer in your pants, because that's exactly what did not happen.",Ted
11605,"Sorry, dude.",Ted
11606,That was me. Me. The one time Marshall forgot his pants?,Ted
11607,"Damn! Stop changing the subject. You have gone too far. You are complicit in breaking the heart of this poor guy.And you, you are best placed to know how it feels.",Marshall
11608,You really do speak of your pants?,Robin
11609,What?,Marshall
11610,"Pant, pant...",Barney
11611,Okay! Lily came to the office to bring me my pants...,Marshall
11612,Why she did this?,Barney
11613,Because I forgot.,Marshall
11614,"Lily, what are you doing here?",Barney
11615,I just give something to Marshall.,Lily
11616,He &quot;give&quot; something. Understood. Nice.,Barney
11617,But I'm in a hurry. I can give it to you?,Lily
11618,"Of course, yes.",Barney
11619,And you give him?,Lily
11620,Wait. I do not know. Yours had better be really good.,Barney
11621,What are you talking?,Lily
11622,What about you?,Barney
11623,"Marshall forgot his pants, so I brought him one.",Lily
11624,"He forgot his pants. Good thing you came because today it has an important meeting, and it would be embarrassing and not at all funny if it were to show no pants. I will make sure he has.",Barney
11625,Awesome. Thank you.,Lily
11626,And you did not give him.,Ted
11627,"Theodore Evelyn Mosby. Of course I gave him. I gave him my word. It is concrete. For cons, I made a few alterations.",Barney
11628,As you can see on page 44 of the contract...,Marshall
11629,You can look at page 44 of the contract?,Marshall
11630,"Please, can I have more... pants?",Barney
11631,More...,Barney
11632,Is that all? It's the story?,Robin
11633,What has happened to Karen?,Marshall
11634,"I'll finish for you. Ted left without saying anything, and Karen got exactly what she wanted.",Lily
11635,Not this time.,Ted
11636,You have a boyfriend?,Ted
11637,"You're unbelievable. You do not have the guts to break up with someone decent. So, you've preferred to ride it all.",Ted
11638,We're both zero for that. But... I think we need to change.Why do not I would start? You are really hurtful and reckless.Goodbye.,Ted
11639,"Sorry, dude.",Ted
11640,I am impressed. For you too have worn it all day?,Robin
11641,It shows my calves.,Marshall
11642,The pants. Still tells.,Barney
11643,"You know, this is perhaps good that you called Karen.",Lily
11644,"Of course. And that for me, too. Later, she spoke with Jerry, and the discussion was that it avoided breaking with me.",Ted
11645,Wait a minute. You said that you never reparlerais him?So how do you know she has followed your advice?,Lily
11646,"Right. On this subject... After breaking up with this guy, we went out, we slept since we're together. It's really okay, this time it's different. Here it is. Be nice!",Ted
11647,"Sorry, can not stay.",Ted
11648,It's unfortunate!,Barney
11649,Disgusted!,Robin
11650,"Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thank you.",Robin
11651,I got a great deal...,Robin
11652,They need a finger to do what I think.,Robin
11653,"Ted, Karen is an idiot.",Marshall
11654,Nice set of forms.,Ted
11655,I put the forms there.,Marshall
11656,"Believe it or not, my friends do not have a say on which I frequent. This is my life. I decide.",Ted
11657,I arrive.,Ted
11658,"I do not know what it is, this shrew. Okay, she has boobs, but... In fact, I see.",Barney
11659,That's because he met her in high school. This is his first girlfriend.,Lily
11660,"For us, Karen is an idiot. For him, this is the first to have touched his penis in hand himself, his mother and pediatrician.",Marshall
11661,It's almost 2am. I must work.,Robin
11662,"How can they call it a &quot;daily&quot;? 4h, it's still the middle of the night. You impressed me.",Lily
11663,"It's been almost a month. I'm used to. And then the show is not bad, right?",Robin
11664,That is clear.,Marshall
11665,I've never seen.,Barney
11666,You've ever watched?,Robin
11667,Sure!,Marshall
11668,I've never seen.,Barney
11669,Your favorite item?,Robin
11670,Weather.,Marshall
11671,I've never seen.,Barney
11672,Have you ever looked.,Robin
11673,Sorry.,Marshall
11674,I just said.,Barney
11675,"I know, this is basic and bland, and it is smaller audiences than the Korean channel that does that Kim Jong Il by the horse. But, friends, it would touch me to know that at least once you look.",Robin
11676,"You know what? This Friday, everyone will come home at 3:30. We leave the pajamas and watch his show.",Marshall
11677,You're the best.,Robin
11678,We want to encourage you.,Lily
11679,I just want to sleep!,Lily
11680,I hate Robin not to have done better.,Marshall
11681,"Hi, guys. Bad news: I was Karen plated. Go ahead.",Ted
11682,I knew you were listening!,Marshall
11683,"We should not celebrate. Ted has just been dumped.Tell us everything, everything that happened. Seriously, do not forget any details. She said what? You, you said what? How you going? If you had to redo it from start, perhaps you...?",Barney
11684,How did that happen?,Lily
11685,"This is totally stupid. We were together, you know, we laughed...",Ted
11686,It's you who love the Chianti 2002.,Ted
11687,Looks like the earring Robin. Bizarre. It's you...,Ted
11688,I know.,Ted
11689,What? Of course not! She had to be found in the laundry.,Ted
11690,"Maybe because I've always been faithful, when thou hast deceived me 6 times, bitch.",Ted
11691,In your face!,Marshall
11692,Right? I too would have said that.,Ted
11693,"Maybe because I've always been faithful, while you... I love you...",Ted
11694,That's it. She's gone.,Ted
11695,What a story. What courage to share it with us.,Barney
11696,Wait. That's your pajamas? You sleep in pajamas suit?,Lily
11697,Of course. You think I'm sleeping in it?,Barney
11698,A coffin.,Ted
11699,It's not look comfortable at all. You wear a tie.,Marshall
11700,"First, it's a tie night. Second, it's not for comfort. This class is to be at any time.",Barney
11701,Why have the class at any time?,Marshall
11702,Let me tell you a story that happened to me recently.,Barney
11703,"It's not an anecdote, it's a porno.",Ted
11704,"This is not &quot;a&quot; skin flick, it's the scene... Forget it.",Lily
11705,"But it could happen. If it happened and I was in top form for these oiled bitches, I would regret it.",Barney
11706,"Sorry, dude, but it is the nightwear most ridiculous I've seen in my life. Finally...",Marshall
11707,"Marshall wearing a nightgown! He wears a nightgown! You know when they say, &quot;Remember, he was wearing a nightgown? &quot;It is now! This is a nightgown. Call it, &quot;Held danger of Ninja,&quot; if you want. You stay still a tr*nsv*stite.",Barney
11708,I do not care. It's comfortable.,Marshall
11709,"Nice to fly to Neverland with Peter Pan? Me, again! It was nice to get out of bed to accompany Charlie to the chocolate? Oh, me, me! Something about Scrooge! Come on, guys. I do all the work.",Barney
11710,"I know. I live with Marshall for 12 years. Every time I put something, it's a victory.",Ted
11711,"Ted, it will start!",Lily
11712,I arrive.,Ted
11713,"Hello, New York. I'm Robin...",Robin
11714,"Marshall, I found an earring Robin on your dresser. You know why the other was in my bed?",Ted
11715,What are you talking?,Marshall
11716,You hate Karen. You told me to break it. It's you. Did you put the loop in my bed for Karen to find.,Ted
11717,I would never...,Marshall
11718,Admit it!,Ted
11719,There's nothing to admit!,Marshall
11720,Why was it on your dresser?,Ted
11721,It is pretty!,Barney
11722,"I swear, if you tell me the truth on the field...",Ted
11723,Wait! Marshall did nothing. It's me. I made you break.,Lily
11724,You made me break with Karen? Are you sick? What right did you do that?,Ted
11725,I did it for your own good. You do not see how it was horrible. She failed the test of the porch.,Lily
11726,What is this test?,Ted
11727,"You, Me and Marshall are friends since college. Imagine how they account for one another. So when I look to the future, I see us all together. (Lily imagines the scene) When will retirees, sipping tea on the porch of our house, playing bridge all day.",Lily
11728,"You know not to play bridge, eh?",Barney
11729,It will take over.,Lily
11730,It's important to stay active.,Marshall
11731,"So whenever you go out with someone for a while, I take the test of the porch. How that person will fit over the years?And when I think of Karen...",Lily
11732,Karen has failed the test of the porch. She had to leave.,Lily
11733,I can not believe you did that.,Ted
11734,"Do you like is great, you, me and Marshall. Really, think about it.",Lily
11735,It's pretty awesome.,Ted
11736,"It is really great! So for that you will marry, one that will join the Team GÃ©niale, the bar is very high. I say that I did well, but...",Lily
11737,You're better off without her.,Marshall
11738,"If the angel Clarence says it's true, it should be.",Barney
11739,"You know what? Go ahead, laugh.",Marshall
11740,Why are you wearing this stuff?,Barney
11741,Several reasons.,Marshall
11742,You can not even give five.,Barney
11743,A: You can not wear anything underneath.,Marshall
11744,I confirm. You can cross your legs?,Ted
11745,Two: It's sexy.,Marshall
11746,I confirm. You can uncross your legs?,Lily
11747,"Three: My grandfather was Olaf and he died at 107 years. Four: No elastic waistband leaving its mark around my Thanksgiving belly. And five: each night as I sleep, it's the most wonderful and free feeling in the world. I feel... as if I was flying. That's how I'm going to bed at night: happy, light. With a heart full of joy. And you?",Marshall
11748,I have to stand still to avoid offending my pajama suit.But at least I do not wear a dress.,Barney
11749,So you're really angry?,Lily
11750,"I know. I mean, I guess if you get all this for Karen, then it may be better.",Ted
11751,"I'm really sorry. I hated to do it again, but Karen had to leave.",Lily
11752,&quot;Redo&quot;? How many times you made me break with my girlfriends?,Ted
11753,Never! Six.,Lily
11754,Like who?,Ted
11755,"No one! Angie. In the second year. She used you to get revenge on her ex, and you will not see it, so...",Lily
11756,... one day she was taking a nap...,Lily
11757,"Creed? Oh, my God, I have to break up with her.",Ted
11758,That's where is my CD of Creed.,Marshall
11759,Who else?,Ted
11760,"Do you remember this strange girl who wanted you to marry him after two months? You loved him in trouble, but you thought there anyway, so...",Lily
11761,That was you? It's crazy!,Ted
11762,"Ted, I did it to help you. You're addicted to the commitment. You fell in love with these women, even if they do not deserve you.",Lily
11763,And if one of them was to be the mother of my children?,Ted
11764,"If there was any chance, I swear, I would have done anything. As Victoria or Stella.",Lily
11765,Or Robin. Or Robin. You made us break too? You made us break too?,Ted
11766,"Stop talking to me as if I were your enemy! You know these women cry, but you have the luxury of not knowing what I know: you have these breaks tragic surely avoided a first marriage crap and very expensive.",Lily
11767,You have made us break up?,Ted
11768,"You do not want the truth, because deep down, you want me to watch over you. And basically, you know that none of these women would have been the mother of your children.",Lily
11769,You have made us break up?,Ted
11770,I did what I had to do.,Lily
11771,You have made us break up?,Ted
11772,Just as I did!,Lily
11773,You made me break with Robin?,Ted
11774,"No, it's not...",Lily
11775,I can not believe it. I need another drink.,Ted
11776,I feel a little breeze there. It's nice.,Barney
11777,You think that's good? Come to the mouth of heating.It's like your bazaar was on a tropical island.,Marshall
11778,The Little Barney says &quot;Mahalo.&quot;,Barney
11779,"Seriously, just what is your problem? How could you do that?",Ted
11780,I did it because I care about you!,Lily
11781,"My God, what has happened?",Barney
11782,You have not seen the show?,Robin
11783,The show! Sorry. It happened something?,Barney
11784,The routine.,Robin
11785,Lily has just told us it made us break.,Ted
11786,What? We do break? What does that mean? And why they wear a night gown?,Robin
11787,A shirt.,Marshall
11788,It's called a shirt.,Barney
11789,"It turns out that Lily has decided to sabotage many of my relationships, including ours.",Ted
11790,"Robin was different. I did not mean that you break, but you wanted different things and you refused to settle it. I could imagine the porch.",Lily
11791,I do not like this scenario.,Marshall
11792,I was just trying to make you talk about your problems. I did not know it would lead to your break.,Lily
11793,"I have a funny joke. Where you see yourself in five years?(Later that night, Lily is with Robin at McClaren's) You know what's funny? Funny questions. Where you see yourself in five years?",Lily
11794,Where do you see yourself in five years?,Ted
11795,And you?,Robin
11796,"Not that I want to make you say, but surely you want to get married.",Lily
11797,I would probably get married.,Ted
11798,You would surely be in Tokyo or Paris.,Lily
11799,I would surely be in Argentina.,Robin
11800,In Argentina?,Ted
11801,"Or Tokyo, or Paris.",Robin
11802,"We have a deadline, does not it?",Ted
11803,My God.,Robin
11804,"You can not manipulate people like that! I've known you for 12 years, but I've never been back!",Ted
11805,I was not...,Lily
11806,I want to hear!,Ted
11807,Calm down! Let us be calm! I have a question. This is how when you're in bed?,Barney
11808,"Come, let's check.",Marshall
11809,"So, without you we would come out still together?",Robin
11810,"Or you'd been together too long, and would have had an incredibly bitter break without even remain friends, and we would never become best friends.",Lily
11811,Do not say that.,Robin
11812,Stop cuddling! You got no right to interfere in my relationships you. You're lucky. You have found the love of your life in a dorm you turn 18. It gives you no right to play God while others are still looking for. You worry so much about who will finish with you on the porch. You know what? Keep it for you.,Ted
11813,It is what happened to your jacket?,Lily
11814,"Soot, breadcrumbs, placenta. You have not even registered?",Robin
11815,"You're at home, every night, and Lily layer always with you?",Barney
11816,"Yeah, marriage, man, unconditional love. You can wear what you want and you get laid.",Marshall
11817,Tell me about marriage.,Barney
11818,"Sometimes when you're married, the smell of breakfast wakes you ready.",Marshall
11819,The coffee too?,Barney
11820,The cafe also. Sometimes she even puts a vase of fresh flowers.,Marshall
11821,"I love flowers. And sometimes when you're afraid of making wrong choices and you're not the one you wanted to be, what it does?",Barney
11822,It says you're great and everything will be fine.,Marshall
11823,It's beautiful. And it helps you to find other girls to sleep with?,Barney
11824,"I guess. If you have agreed, perhaps. The guy had a hard day. We'll talk tomorrow. Good night, champ.",Marshall
11825,"Ted, I'm sorry. No matter who you marry. I know it will be great because she will think you are. To prove my sincerity, I have prepared a surprise for you and Karen at the top. Kisses, Lily.",Lily
11826,PS: Sorry that the envelope is opened. I read what she wrote. Marshall.,Marshall
11827,"I realized that no matter what my friends think of my girlfriend, but it really matters what my girlfriend thinks of my friends.",Ted
11828,"So, it's over?",Robin
11829,"Yes. If you wanna be my guest, Lily is a sacred stove.",Ted
11830,"beef pie, macaroni and cheese, butter cookie house.",Robin
11831,Normal Marshall dies at age 68.,Ted
11832,Thank you.,Robin
11833,"Basically, Lily made us break.",Robin
11834,It makes you wonder.,Ted
11835,"If it had not been there, we always go out together?",Robin
11836,"Maybe. She was right. We were not ready. We needed to move forward, we do our stuff. It is always the case.",Ted
11837,"We should make a pact. If the years pass and only 40 years old, one is always alone...",Robin
11838,Will you be my wife back?,Ted
11839,"A girl dreams of hearing those words. A million times, yes!",Robin
11840,"Okay, that's it. Do we must etablire rules?",Ted
11841,Genre?,Robin
11842,"I know. As not to become huge, that sort of thing.",Ted
11843,Just one thing: no nightgown.,Robin
11844,I'll never wear.,Ted
11845,Wooden beams immersed in natural light from the atrium.They will love it!,Ted
11846,I need to hear Lily.,Marshall
11847,"On the roof, a Zen garden to pray silently. In the lobby, a fountain where local kids can make wishes. The new GNB, your workplace and your home. Thank you, and.. welcome home.",Ted
11848,"Yeah, it's Ted. No, no. I have not approved the change in plans for the new GNB headquarters, which I am the chief architect, just 30 years. Yes, I'm single and I give to charity.What is the relationship? Okay, bye, Mr. Mayor. You know it was bogus?",Ted
11849,"Look at Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars. If I could get a celebrity, it would be Scarlett Johansson. Canon, talented and you do not turn as Woody Allen's father without issue.",Barney
11850,"If I got a celebrity, it would be Lily. This is the star of my heart.",Marshall
11851,For me it would be Hugh Jackman.,Lily
11852,"You know, the celebrities, they like really weird sex stuff. Believe me.",Robin
11853,How do you know that?,Barney
11854,"It's embarrassing, but I... I came home one evening with a celebrity.",Robin
11855,My God! Seriously?,Lily
11856,"He wanted to do weird things with me, so I left. That's it.End of story.",Robin
11857,"No, not the end of history. I need to know who, what, when and where. Balance!",Lily
11858,"Please, calm down. You swallow too much air.",Marshall
11859,"But before you poursuives, I'm flattered, but technically I'm not a celebrity. Also, one last time, the mask, it was a joke.",Barney
11860,"Not you, Barney.",Robin
11861,Who's who?,Lily
11862,Now you've spun him hiccups.,Marshall
11863,"I'll tell you anything specific. But all I will say is that he is Canadian, but you know it. And he brought home by offering to show me a single collection.",Robin
11864,What do you mean &quot;collection&quot;?,Marshall
11865,As you collect stamps or coins. But I say nothing.,Robin
11866,Tell us at least the weird thing he wanted to do.,Barney
11867,"I know not what you call it, but we have a name for it in Canada. Listen, I've already said too much.",Robin
11868,So the mystery celebrity who collects something mysterious asked you to do a mystery Canadian sex act.,Lily
11869,Yes.,Robin
11870,Tell us.,Lily
11871,I'll tell you. But only if you correctly guess the three parties.,Robin
11872,It is simply impossible.,Marshall
11873,Right.,Robin
11874,I do not even know of Canadian sex act.,Lily
11875,"You have the Sled Dog, the Lobster Trap, the Mounted Police.",Barney
11876,How do you know that?,Lily
11877,"Canadiansexact.org, this is a favorite.",Barney
11878,Point org?,Marshall
11879,Yeah. It's nonprofit. They just want to disseminate information.,Barney
11880,"I just had a conversation strange. A woman at the GNB told me that the new tower was abandoned last month. It's crazy, right? What is this look?",Ted
11881,It is said? It should.,Barney
11882,No. I want to.,Marshall
11883,There's been no light.,Barney
11884,What's going on?,Ted
11885,"It's time you know. A few weeks ago, Bilson called us.",Marshall
11886,"Dude, Ted will be devastated.",Marshall
11887,"Tell him, you're his best friend.",Marshall
11888,"No, it's you.",Barney
11889,"No, it's really you. Shhh, it happens.",Marshall
11890,"White or Asian? You see, I hardly know him.",Barney
11891,How are you?,Ted
11892,You okay?,Marshall
11893,"I'm frustrated. The least innovative thing in my drawings, Bilson cuts with a machete. I hate to depend on what kind of guy.",Ted
11894,You should leave the project.,Barney
11895,"It is clear, leave him. It is unworthy of you.",Marshall
11896,It's decided. A new beginning! May the winds be with you...,Barney
11897,"Are you kidding? They still come to turn a guy in my box.Bilson, is heavy, it is clear, but without this project, I have more work.",Ted
11898,It's funny you mention the project. Because...,Barney
11899,"You're super good. Keep it up, man. Your hair, your teeth are beautiful now. You shine like a diamond!",Marshall
11900,"Thank you. I needed it. Well, I go back to work. I must insert a plank in the dark hallway of Bilson. You have understood me.",Ted
11901,What was that?,Barney
11902,I have an idea. The next two months Ted has paid anyway. We could not let it continue and not to tell her? He had a tough year. Let the fun a little.,Marshall
11903,You suggest a complicated lie in the long term that implies a lot of discipline. A guy like you will not succeed.,Barney
11904,But if I can.,Marshall
11905,"Lie to me, there.",Barney
11906,I have a spaceship.,Marshall
11907,What kind of fuel?,Barney
11908,I have no spaceship.,Marshall
11909,"But no! Defend yourself! If someone asks, diverts it from the original lie with other lies. I show you. I have a pony.Question me.",Barney
11910,It is what color?,Marshall
11911,"When I was Dandelion, her complexion was of a deep hazel, unfortunately, his barn is located near a chemical plant, which contaminated water. Over time, it became a dull gray and the vet can not do anything to help.",Barney
11912,"My God! It's horrible. Dandelion will make it? Okay...You're strong! Dandelion is not sick, huh?",Marshall
11913,So the tour is canceled and you really have lied to me.,Ted
11914,We did it to protect you.,Marshall
11915,I think so. My two best friends have planted and I saw nothing.,Ted
11916,"In Canada, it's called a snow plow Vicious.",Lily
11917,This tower was the dream job and it went up in smoke.,Ted
11918,"Sorry, Ted.",Marshall
11919,I need a drink.,Ted
11920,The poor. It's moved if I return to Canada on sex?,Lily
11921,Not at all.,Marshall
11922,You've been slow.,Barney
11923,What is a Zamboni with 2 hands?,Lily
11924,"Well, the only thing that carries the woman is skates with his hands.",Robin
11925,Pack milk Manitoba?,Lily
11926,"It's like the Moustache of Chicago, but the person below wearing a combi.",Robin
11927,A Lobster Trap of Newfoundland?,Lily
11928,"I dunno, I want to know. These people are crazy.",Robin
11929,"Well, I decided my first proposal.",Lily
11930,"Okay, but I say only if you find the person, the act and the collection.",Robin
11931,"Well, I'm starting. Bryan Adams. He collects baseball cards and he wanted to make you... an oily Kayak.",Lily
11932,No.,Robin
11933,"Wayne Gretzky, former Hot Wheels, an Eskimo kneeling.",Barney
11934,No.,Robin
11935,"Kiefer Sutherland, souvenir glasses, tights and a Pancake.",Marshall
11936,No. I would have accepted it.,Robin
11937,"Wait. If they canceled the project a month ago, why did I go every week to see the new working group?",Ted
11938,"Of course, you could not see you point and Bilson.",Barney
11939,So we... invented the working group. It was enough just to gather a team.,Marshall
11940,"You see Roy Waterman, Vice President of Venture Capital? It's actually... Roy maintenance. (In the hallway...) I'm sorry, Roy. How would you like to make you some money?",Marshall
11941,"Louisa Mendoza, Vice President at Capital exÃ©cutie, It's actually... Louisa from the cafeteria. (In the canteen...) Louisa, I need your help, but forbidden to speak.",Marshall
11942,Exactly. This is an important secret. How do you say &quot;secret&quot; in Spanish?,Marshall
11943,"Okay. Albondigas. This will be our little albondigas. I have balls, please? Arthur and Nasmith, the eccentric genius, investment guru, it's actually... Arty the cracked one-man band of 15th Street. (In the street...) Excuse me. One can argue?",Marshall
11944,It was completed with the group of trainees and paid $ 50 for them to look enthusiastic when you talked...,Marshall
11945,That was one of the most inspired designs of my career. I was so excited.,Ted
11946,"Alex Trebek, a Guardian EventÃ©, teddy bear!",Lily
11947,No.,Robin
11948,Damn!,Lily
11949,Wait. It explains what happened to Louisa.,Ted
11950,Good job.,Marshall
11951,All right!,Barney
11952,Louisa. What can we do about it? Do not like you not understand. You feel the same. After all!,Ted
11953,"No, it's not good! Damn, you're in the working group!",Ted
11954,Is there anything else you want to tell me?,Ted
11955,When you played third base for the softball team GNB.,Marshall
11956,"There is no softball team. We just rented a field, a bunch of guys together so they make you a hero.",Barney
11957,My lap of honor was bogus?,Ted
11958,"Sorry, we knew you'd be unemployed soon. We wanted you to feel good. Friends do that.",Marshall
11959,Lying?,Ted
11960,"Sometimes, yes, to protect them.",Marshall
11961,False! Never lie to his friends. I should never have lied.,Ted
11962,Really? And this open mic night at the Comedy Club?,Barney
11963,"You're like me, people? Have you ever considered the amount of fish species? And... the name of these fish?Here are a few. &quot;Trout. &quot;Right? &quot;Sturgeon. &quot;I think so buddy.&quot;Salmon. &quot;I'll say it again... Salmon. Who thought it was a good idea? &quot;Bar. &quot;This guy is what I mean. &quot;Halibut. &quot;Thank you, good evening. How do I?",Marshall
11964,Super. Very funny.,Ted
11965,Fatal... Thursday evening for everyone.,Barney
11966,Timeout. You do not like fish?,Marshall
11967,It was horrible! You've just read a list of fish.,Ted
11968,Whatever... This proves my point. You lied to me to protect me.,Marshall
11969,"It has nothing to do! I lost one month of my life to work on a dead project. I could have spent that time to find new contracts. Instead, I'll go tomorrow morning and probably get fired. Best Screenplay, my boss yelling at me going in front of everyone.",Ted
11970,"For me, it's called a...",Robin
11971,A Totem of Saskatoon. It's here.,Lily
11972,"Hello, lying bastards. No lies before I go to work to get fired?",Ted
11973,Nice shirt.,Barney
11974,You're the devil.,Ted
11975,"What if we told you that you found another project to GNB, where you have to redo part of the 20th floor.",Marshall
11976,"If it's a lie, it's really bad. And I will do what?",Ted
11977,"This is the P.T.E. 18th floor. Basically, Bilson wants a piece like that, two floors above us.",Barney
11978,"Wait, what is a P.T.E.?",Ted
11979,Room for Transitional Employees.,Barney
11980,What does that mean?,Ted
11981,It's a place where a manager and an employee initiate a transfer of knowledge about an impending career change.,Barney
11982,It turns people here.,Marshall
11983,It's horrible. Why have a special room to turn people?,Ted
11984,GNB think we need a safe place to meet new.,Marshall
11985,It's serious there.,Barney
11986,"Leaving space dismissal, you get into what I call &quot;the Renaissance Corridor Quiet.&quot; Here, an oval room of rest with psychological support. Right there, after the fountain of the New Departure. And here it is. Instead of a sad and gloomy cell, a protective womb... giving birth to a new life.",Ted
11987,Really?,Barney
11988,Thank you.,Ted
11989,Absolutely.,Ted
11990,"OK, I think this wall...",Ted
11991,What?,Ted
11992,But...,Ted

11999,But this info does not leave the table.,Robin
12000,My God. I am so excited. (Robin passes him a paper) I will read.,Lily
12001,Read it.,Barney
12002,Read it.,Marshall
12003,"I will read it. Let's go. &quot;The Frozen Snowshoe,&quot; &quot;Old King Clancy&quot;, &quot;The Plateaux of Harvey.&quot;",Lily
12004,So?,Robin
12005,I do not understand any of these words.,Lily
12006,One of them is supposed to be famous?,Barney
12007,Who the hell... The Old King Clancy is?,Marshall
12008,"This is not the person is the sexual act. It's like the Sacramento Turtleneck, but with maple syrup.",Robin
12009,"And fame, this is Harvey LÃ©plateaux?",Marshall
12010,"No, it's the collection. Harvey trays. These orange trays they give you when you eat at Harvey. Restaurants? Will you take a trip on the Trans-Canada Highway, you have a hollow between Milverton and Wawa, where you stop eating, eh? At Harvey. More than 12,000 customers!",Robin
12011,So fame was...,Lily
12012,"The Frozen Snowshoe. Oh, my God! You know Racket jelly? This is the most famous pro wrestler of Canada. I met him after his victory over Rick &quot;The Daredevil&quot; at the Rogers Memorial Arena in Kamloops in 2002. A classic.",Robin
12013,"So you say you Racket Jelly invited him home to show you trays of Harvey, and you've asked him to do an Old King Clancy?",Lily
12014,"Right. And I'm serious, do not tell anyone.",Robin
12015,My hiccups are gone. Perhaps forever.,Lily
12016,You again. You even found a way to spoil it. Why?Why let yourself do we as a country?,Barney
12017,"Hey, Mister Whisper. You should not be up there to draw your super PTE?",Marshall
12018,I'm more about the project.,Ted
12019,What?,Marshall
12020,Bilson fired me.,Ted
12021,You're kidding.,Marshall
12022,What does that mean for your company? You're going to be fired?,Lily
12023,"Actually, I just resign.",Ted
12024,Why?,Marshall
12025,"I can not work for large corporations with no heart. In selling me your &quot;working group&quot;, I was the most inspired work of my career. In fact, you reminded me how my job could be fun when I'm not dealing with Bilson, so... I resigned.",Ted
12026,"They've turned, eh?",Barney
12027,"Yes, sir. But I have good benefits and I have made a great decision. I'll start my own box.",Ted
12028,It's exciting.,Lily
12029,With this economy?,Barney
12030,"So, do we want it?",Marshall
12031,"Ultimately, I am grateful.",Ted
12032,What was it with Bilson?,Barney
12033,"After he proposed a career change, I made an impromptu presentation with a four-step approach that put him in the knee.",Ted
12034,You've hit with a chair?,Barney
12035,Yeah.,Ted
12036,Well done.,Barney
12037,"It's very impressive, The Frozen Snowshoe.",Robin

12041,"Yeah, almost.",Barney
12042,Go! You want that!,Barney
12043,Come on.,Barney
12044,Shit.,Barney
12045,"I know, I'm not your precious rules, McCracken, but, damn, the results are there!",Barney
12046,You forget what it's there. Your fat ass is stuck here for too long.,Barney
12047,My pleasure. Do not do that. This game is all I have.And I nearly enough tickets for the remote controlled helicopter. Pity.,Barney
12048,You regret it.,Barney
12049,I can not believe you're kicked out of laser tag. Are you gonna do?,Marshall
12050,What shall I do? I'll tell you that Ted and I will do. We will introduce and apply the PQ everywhere.,Barney
12051,"Barney, you're too old to put toilet paper because you can play laser tag more. And by the way, too old for laser tag.",Ted
12052,"Ted, laser tag has no age limit. As the striptease in the West Midlle.",Barney
12053,"Yeah, whatever. I added laser tag to the list of Murtaugh.",Ted
12054,No list of Murtaugh.,Barney
12055,What is the Murtaugh list?,Robin
12056,"... two, one, chug!",Marshall
12057,"It's hard to admit, but with age, we can do certain things.This is why I have this list, not to make the mistake of thinking that I can still make a sleepless night.",Ted
12058,I'm too old for this stuff.,Marshall
12059,Or eat a whole pizza in one sitting.,Ted
12060,I'm too old for this stuff.,Marshall
12061,Or put posters on the wall without a frame.,Ted
12062,"&quot;Riggs. &quot;I'm too old for this stuff. In fact, it's Lethal w*apon?",Marshall
12063,"I know. It looks pumped. An old cop associated with a young and rebellious. It reminds you of anything? Mackleroy and LaFleur. Do not tell me you have never seen Mackleroy and LaFleur. This is the best action movie of all time Canadian. Mackleroy is a young Mountie whose horse is k*ll by evil Americans, and LaFleur, his old partner grumpy and Afro-Canadian, just buy a nice fishing shack in northern Alberta...",Robin
12064,I gotta go.,Marshall
12065,"Hi, baby. Good workout.",Lily
12066,What? It's still one-man band? Because it was crap.,Robin
12067,My God! Orange wedges. That's nice. What are you doing here?,Marshall
12068,I could not resist. I wanted to see Marshmallow coach at work.,Lily
12069,"The children, who wants to stop earlier and eat orange slices?",Marshall
12070,"Yeah? No way! Oranges, it's for the winners, and you little shits, you have not yet put one basket! Shame on you, shame on you Miss Aldrin, and worse, necks make me ashamed! Enough! su1c1de, on the line! And make it snappy!Here we go.",Marshall
12071,"There's nothing on this list for which you're too old. In fact, if you did everything on the Murtaugh list, I would call it a nice weekend.",Barney
12072,"Barney, you have more 18 years. If you did the whole list, you would die. It was not a challenge.",Ted
12073,"Challenge accepted. The next 24 hours, I will do everything on the list. And after that, you go to the PQ laser tag with me.",Barney
12074,And if you fail?,Ted
12075,I'll spend three hours listening to you talk about architecture.,Barney
12076,"It works for me. Robin, you do the honors?",Ted
12077,An agreement of honor!,Robin
12078,"Come on guys, you do it!",Barney
12079,Are you sure you want to do that? You know how it is.,Robin
12080,"There's some pretty hefty on the list. Finally, do you really think Barney is going to get ear pierced?",Ted
12081,"&quot;To pierce the ear. &quot;Done. Well, I go to a laundry at my mother. (Barney hand, then returned several hours later) Do you mind if I use your futon?",Barney
12082,There is no futon.,Robin
12083,"Put it there, guys.",Barney
12084,What's the matter?,Robin
12085,It's on the list. &quot;Landing on the futon with a friend rather than going to the hotel. &quot;,Barney
12086,I'm too old for this stuff.,Robin
12087,You got anything in your ear? It looks like the inside of a pumpkin after Halloween.,Ted
12088,"What, this? Just a quick foul '. Just a kid like me has to worry about. Then, &quot;pushing a medical&quot; on the list. (His phone rings) Hold on. Bar here...",Barney
12089,"It is not stop! You know, it's funny, I came to teach them... Do not stop running! All this time, it is they who have taught me things. (He throws the basketball on a kid) you not being there! You fall!",Marshall
12090,Done. (Barney is McClaren's) &quot;Drinking shots with strangers. &quot;Done.,Barney
12091,"OK, Barney? You seem to have a bad back.",Ted
12092,"No, it's just the raver's hump. I like it. It brings me closer to my glass. A youth! (He can not drink his glass) You should have a straw?",Barney
12093,There's a side admirable in its way to remain young.Who wants to be old?,Robin
12094,"This guy. Life is a meal and old age, the dessert. I get so many worries about the future. Where will my career? Who will I marry? When you're old, you do not worry, because all this has happened before. You got pumps and a comfortable seat for the stairs. That's perfect.",Ted
12095,"It's not perfect, it's pathetic. You can not skip to the end.The best thing is the journey.",Robin
12096,"I thought that, too, you'll understand when you grow older.",Ted
12097,"Marshall, you can avoid the attack today?",Lily
12098,"I will not attack, Lily. I attack this pervasive culture of failure. I have to toughen them if you want to win the match tomorrow.",Marshall
12099,Winning? There are no points.,Lily
12100,What?,Marshall
12101,There are no points.,Lily
12102,"You not count... What interest not to do? How do you know... Lily, what were you doing with the team before I arrive?",Marshall
12103,I was training.,Lily
12104,That's my little angels. You are luminous beings of light.,Lily
12105,Gender: joy joy!,Lily
12106,"Because that's the point of playing, having fun.",Lily
12107,"The point of playing is to win the trophy. And if you do not know who wins, wins the trophy?",Marshall
12108,"Everyone. This is a participation trophy, everyone has one.",Lily
12109,Everything that's Chinese to me.,Marshall
12110,"Hi, this is Barney.",Barney
12111,And Robin.,Robin
12112,We can not answer because...,Barney
12113,He watches football and I'm...,Robin
12114,"Part shopping. Leave a message, you are reminded...",Barney
12115,... soon...,Robin
12116,... we...,Barney
12117,"&quot;Making an autoresponder message to two annoying.&quot;Done. It will probably cost me a few appointments, but it's okay.",Barney
12118,Your ear begins to feel.,Robin
12119,It's good.,Barney
12120,"I hate to refuse, but you told me that the turkey was extremely thin, and see for yourself.",Ted
12121,Okay. It's good. You have your own list.,Robin
12122,What?,Ted
12123,A list of things that you are too young. Do all these things and tell me if you still want to be old.,Robin
12124,"Removes &quot;colonoscopy&quot; and &quot;sleeping with an old&quot;, and is a cinch.",Ted
12125,"New bet, then. If you can finish your list before me, we will cover the laser PQ and you pay toilet paper.Biodegradable and not this crap. I want up there forever.",Barney
12126,"Well, if I finished first, it's six hours of study of American architecture from the early 20th, and you can not ever do something in the list of Murtaugh. This is for your own good.",Ted
12127,Bet held.,Barney
12128,An agreement of honor!,Robin
12129,"Marshall, they were in kindergarten. It teaches not basketball like that.",Lily
12130,Sure. I learned that way.,Marshall
12131,Are you kidding? What kind of sociopath told you like that?,Lily
12132,"Come on, Dad. I'm tired.",Marshall
12133,I'm trying.,Marshall
12134,"With my father, no mercy and I did not ask. I really need to call this guy. Continue stretching!",Marshall
12135,&quot;Put on reading glasses. &quot;Done. &quot;Yelled the boy from the neighborhood. &quot;With pleasure. (Ted was about to leave when Robin and Barney come but this box) What happened to you?,Ted
12136,I just had a little &quot;screw up my knee and it hurts&quot; incident.,Barney
12137,How did you do?,Ted
12138,It... &quot;Helped to move the sixth floor walk against pizza and beer.&quot;,Barney
12139,Or you helped steal the sixth floor. They were in a hurry and left the pictures.,Robin
12140,16 pm! Supper time.,Ted
12141,"Your father was hard on you. It's ugly, but you do not have to be like him. You can learn from mistakes.",Lily
12142,"Errors? Lily, result. The guy was successful. He taught me to be a winner. This is what I teach these kids. And besides, this is what I will do with our children.",Marshall
12143,"OK, enough. This is not how we will raise our children!And that's not how you gonna lead this team! In tomorrow's game, if you're anything but a teddy bear with the cotton candy and rainbows, I foudroierai gaze so hard that you bruise! The times I've found your internet history, it was a mere side! Is that clear?",Lily
12144,There are different...,Marshall
12145,Is that clear?,Lily
12146,"Yes, ma'am. What is ironic is that...",Marshall
12147,Ted Calls. I want to go.,Barney
12148,Okay. I call it. But it is 4:30 am. It will not be awakened.,Robin
12149,Got up at 4am... Done.,Ted
12150,It answers?,Barney
12151,I have not called yet.,Robin
12152,"Hurry up, Robin.",Barney
12153,Okay. &quot;Take time to answer the phone. &quot;,Ted
12154,"Come on, Ted. I was given aspirin and I do not think it was.",Barney
12155,Done.,Ted
12156,"I know I was a little hard on you, the last two days.And I apologize. Today, we will not think of victory. We'll go there and... have fun.",Marshall
12157,"Let them score easily. Now you're sitting. Great.Addison is not football. Do not sh**t! Unless you find it funny, in this case, have fun though. It was not a foul, referee?",Marshall
12158,"No tone, Kenny. Good job. Thank you very much.See you later.",Marshall
12159,"As a manager, I threw in the towel. This bet is over.Your ear looks like a Danish pastry in a French breakfast.",Robin
12160,"No, he remains a. &quot;The beer funnel. &quot;",Barney
12161,"It happens. I found these weird Russian beers, in the basement.",Ted
12162,The Russian beer? I will take a bierofski. Bierofski. Got it?,Robin
12163,"Yes, it's... a little hot. I hope this is not a problem.",Ted
12164,"No, no. Okay. You won, I hate it. I hate it. My back is k*ll me. At the rave, I was mistaken for a cop. I have an earache so I can hear... I hear my own ear. Think about it. My clothes... What... Take that! I have redeemed you your best costume for twice its price. This is... $ 30. And throw the shoes. You won, Ted. I will not make anything of the Murtaugh list. I'm too old for this stuff.",Barney
12165,"You know, yesterday I went to bed at 20h because it was on the list and I could not sleep... because it was 20h. So I watched Lethal w*apon.",Ted
12166,"I still could not sleep, so I watched Lethal w*apon 2. And then 3. And in the middle of Lethal w*apon 4, I realized...",Ted
12167,"... that Murtaugh kept repeating: &quot;I'm too old for this stuff,&quot; but every time he says, he changes his mind, made another movie, and stuff. What I'm trying to say is that... the toilet, age.Will cover the PQ laser tag.",Ted
12168,And then the hospital.,Barney
12169,"Good job, guys. At least, there are no points, eh? No idea of the score. It could be 53-0. It could be something else.It's 53-0.",Marshall
12170,"You do not do anything wrong. It's great that you lost, because in life, no matter the effort you make, or how much you try, people give you things. Since graduation, jobs, promotions. No matter what you do on the ground, as... As you're having fun.",Marshall
12171,Do not look at me like that.,Lily
12172,I take it anymore! Your coaching is crazy!,Marshall
12173,Stop yelling at me!,Lily
12174,I'm sorry. But is what I can do it my way?,Marshall
12175,"OK, but I'll do it my way too. With the guitar.",Lily
12176,There is a werewolf on the ground! It can not be legit.,Marshall
12177,"They look different, the children, but make sure they feel surrounded.",Lily
12178,"It was not a market, right? You're k*ll me! You k*ll me outright!",Marshall
12179,I beg you to put me in one.,Marshall
12180,I understand that you like it not.,Lily
12181,I love it. I worked hard. It's nice to be appreciated at its true value.,Marshall
12182,"I know, baby.",Lily
12183,Your way is perhaps not completely stupid.,Marshall
12184,Thank you. Yours is.,Lily
12185,Really?,Barney
12186,I heard a joke at work.,Barney
12187,"Come on. She will not like it. It's funny for the guys, not girls.",Ted
12188,"It's sexist! When it's funny, it's funny. Lily's cool. She'll love it.",Barney
12189,Do it yourself.,Marshall
12190,Tell it.,Lily
12191,Ready? What is the difference between jam and Nutella? (Marshall laughs) It's funny.,Barney
12192,For the guys.,Ted
12193,She will not like it.,Marshall
12194,Why do not I decide? What is the difference between jam and Nutella?,Lily
12195,"Yeah, I can not hang out with you.",Lily
12196,Come on. It's funny. This is...,Barney
12197,I told you so.,Ted
12198,She'll be back.,Barney
12199,Thank you. And thank you for letting me use the apartment.,Ted
12200,"Yeah, sure. Anything you want.",Robin
12201,"A little thing, do you mind to cut off the TV during labor?",Ted
12202,It's not work!,Robin
12203,"Sorry. It's just... I can not concentrate during the Wheel of Fortune... A penny saved is a penny, Helen!",Ted
12204,"I know you're nervous, but we must stop procrastinating. You've spent two days to choose the pen official Mosbius Designs.",Robin
12205,I've suggested! I removed the felt. I make fun of that? The felt is back.,Ted
12206,You know for layoffs?,Barney
12207,"Yes, I know. I tag. Are you worried?",Marshall
12208,"Are you kidding? I know one thing about this company. I will never be fired. It is likely that one day I was stranded on a beach with no footprints or teeth, but I will not fire.",Barney
12209,I would like to have your insurance.,Marshall
12210,You just gotta find a way to make you absolutely critical.,Barney
12211,I work harder than anyone in my division.,Marshall
12212,Keep your job has nothing to do with being a hard worker. You need something.,Barney
12213,What do you mean something?,Marshall
12214,"You know, something that makes you funny and loved, as Marcus Denisco.",Barney
12215,I love Chow-man. They can not fire him. You know what I like about Chow-man?,Marshall
12216,It's always food.,Barney
12217,It's always food.,Marshall
12218,You see? You need it. You need that thing that makes you a man.,Barney
12219,I have this thing that makes me a guy. Maybe even a guy and a half.,Marshall
12220,"Not this stuff. You know, something. Toy-like man.",Barney
12221,That's great!,Marshall
12222,Claw tape!,Barney
12223,I love Toy-man.,Marshall
12224,You see? You need something. Youtube-like man.,Barney
12225,You're right. I need something.,Marshall
12226,But choose wisely. You want to become the horrible man Massage.,Barney
12227,You filled it. Grub-man has a panna cotta in his office.,Barney
12228,"Hi, Douglas.",Marshall
12229,"I was relaxed, two seconds ago.",Marshall
12230,Who are you?,Robin
12231,What's going on?,Robin
12232,I would not refuse a cup of coffee.,Ted
12233,You're right next door!,Robin
12234,So now Ted is assisted to do nothing.,Robin
12235,"PJ is a great help. Install the desktop, create the Web site. And in return, I guide a young brilliant mind.",Ted
12236,"Yes, the guide.",Robin
12237,I want you to go out today and... put your hands on the buildings. Okay? Sense the vibrations of the concrete. Listen to the stories that you tell the stones. And going to the cleaners.,Ted
12238,All right.,Ted
12239,This table just told me that you're an idiot.,Robin
12240,This idea of being a guide is to procrastinate the fact of calling customers.,Robin
12241,"I do not procrastinate. I just want everything to be perfect, right? I have only one test.",Ted
12242,"Okay, but PJ does not help.",Robin
12243,"If Ted says that PJ is necessary to society, then PJ will go nowhere.",Barney
12244,You see? It is useful.,Ted
12245,"PJ is a guy? PJ, this is not a hottie you f*ck?",Barney
12246,"No, I guide him.",Ted
12247,"A Guide. I guided a young, once. I made him my co-pilot. Then one day, he hired an assistant to work 3 meters from her room, which... Check it out... is not a hottie, proving he has never listened. You know how to call this type?",Barney
12248,Ted Mosby?,Ted
12249,"Maybe. I remember more. Because for me he is dead!(He rises) PJ will receive a mail with a disruptive place, it should in any circumstances be three days and then send it to me.",Barney
12250,"I thought of something to become indispensable.The Ecolo-man! Everyone loves recycling, eh?",Marshall
12251,Fired. What else you got?,Barney
12252,I have others. Ties-Fun-man.,Marshall
12253,Fired.,Barney
12254,Info-Unusual-man?,Marshall
12255,Did you know? Whether you're fired?,Barney
12256,Stretch-man?,Marshall
12257,upside down VirÃ©.,Barney
12258,The Monty-Python-man?,Marshall
12259,We are the knights who say... You're fired.,Barney
12260,Wait! I ran a simulation league baseball in school.,Marshall
12261,Not bad. You got maybe something.,Barney
12262,Great! Great! I Simulates-man!,Marshall
12263,"Actually, you'll Sports-man. We have already Simulates-man.",Barney
12264,"Hi, Frank.",Barney
12265,"Hello? Hello, PJ. Where are you? You're never late.You're mounted on the Empire State Building? Listen to the old lady. She knows stories. Take your time. (Hangs up) Wait.&quot;Ted Mosby House.&quot; The call comes from within! (He opens the bedroom door and discovered Robin in bed with PJ) This is not the Empire State Building. You can not sleep with my assistant. I try to work here, me. How did that happen?",Ted
12266,"At noon, when you go to any walk of reflection, that leaves us time to spend together.",Robin
12267,Inspiration... do your work.,Ted
12268,"Tell me, PJ, I have a question for you architecture.Ted's ass what taste?",Robin
12269,It's locked?,Robin
12270,"Listen, PJ. And I want you to think seriously before answering. You tell me I can not go to the bathroom with me?",Robin
12271,Why does it excite me?,Robin
12272,There's billions of guys on Earth. Why do you sleep with him?,Ted
12273,"When I leave the job, it is 5:30 am. Got an idea of guys I meet?",Robin
12274,"So, you get up very early to discuss the European market? How is it?",Robin
12275,"First, I know Simulates-man, this is a good match.Second, it must stop! If you distract PJ, you lose productivity.",Ted
12276,What productivity? You did not call a single customer.,Robin
12277,"Once launched the website, printed brochures, and the choice of games at the business seminar, I will call.",Ted
12278,Seminar?,Robin
12279,Sports-man. I heard people talking about your club.,Barney
12280,"It's a bit harder than I thought. Registration fees, transaction charges penalty, I... keeps a lot of money.",Marshall
12281,"60, 80, 100. $ 18 000 in cash. It's nothing. I'll bring it home and put them in a safe place. (Marshall is in the street) OK, walk down the street with money in his pocket. Not touch the money. It's so obvious. Be natural. The baby looks at me.Babies can smell money. It is known! I carry a lot of money!",Marshall
12282,"Really, dude, I know not how long I'll keep.",Marshall
12283,Last week you were a waste that nobody was looking.Now you're Sports-man.,Barney
12284,A waste?,Marshall
12285,Last week!,Barney
12286,This is Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. How is the home office?,Marshall
12287,"Okay, until Robin sleeps with my assistant.",Ted
12288,"This is our apartment. You let a cake on the counter, Mama's going to offer a slice.",Robin
12289,"I've told you, commits a pretty assistant with whom you can sleep instead of hiring an assistant with whom Robin sleeps. Of course he'll sleep with her. It is the coolest on the planet. I am off topic! You're an idiot! This is my message!You're an idiot! An angry person, that's not enough! Marshall with me!",Barney
12290,"Dude, why are you so upset that Ted does not sleep with the people he hires?",Marshall
12291,Because it hurts!,Barney
12292,How so?,Marshall
12293,It hurts because I love... when Ted... layer with women. I am a very devoted friend! Lily is the only one I can talk. Tell him to talk to me.,Barney
12294,"I'll try, but no warranty. She is still shocked by this joke. This joke. It tore our group, which turns the people I love against the other. Frankly, I would... I would like this joke is never entered our lives.",Marshall
12295,"It's funny anyway, right?",Barney
12296,It's very funny.,Marshall
12297,"Good news, PJ. The brochures just arrived. Great choice for coverage. I like that instead of one of my creations, you to choose that.",Ted
12298,"You think so? Listen to PJ, the website is still not done.You're not even come to the seminar... In fact, I saw a sh**ting star... and you're late every day. Sorry, PJ. I must be concentrated. You're fired.",Ted
12299,You're fired.,Ted
12300,One more.,Robin
12301,Stop.,Ted
12302,I'll miss you too.,Robin
12303,You've already tired of him.,Ted
12304,"It is driving me crazy. When PJ was working, he was sexy. The keeper of the key toilet. A sexy guy that says when you can go to the bathroom or not? It's the dream.",Robin
12305,&quot;It's the dream&quot;? The dream? As mentioned by Martin Luther King?,Ted
12306,"I have to stop, right? I know not break.",Robin
12307,"Listen... Dude, I know.",Robin
12308,"Yes, it's just... It's not really... that, you know?",Robin
12309,I feel it.,Robin
12310,But friends and others.,Robin
12311,"My God, this is the worst break.",Ted
12312,"If this is what you want, I totally understand.",Robin
12313,"You see, Sports-man. People adore you.",Barney
12314,"I can be more Sports-man. I'm going crazy! I keep receiving text messages, emails and calls in the middle of the night. Sometimes I even think that I follow.",Marshall
12315,"Seriously, it's over.",Marshall
12316,No.,Marshall
12317,Are you kidding?,Robin
12318,Are you kidding?,Ted
12319,"Apparently, Robin and PJ are together again.",Marshall
12320,You're kidding!,Barney
12321,How are you?,Marshall
12322,"As Lily not speaking to me, I must tell you something.And it's not easy to say, OK? I... wait... 'm... wait... love...wait... of... wait... a... wait... some... wait...",Barney
12323,I know you're in love with Robin.,Marshall
12324,What?,Barney
12325,Lily told me.,Marshall
12326,She told you? Great. I guess you marrez my back all this time.,Barney
12327,"Actually, oddly, we both think you're meant for each other.",Marshall
12328,Really?,Barney
12329,It even tries to sit on the same side for you to sit side by side.,Marshall
12330,"Really? This is so cute. But let's be clear. I do not like it, OK? It's just that... I miss when she is not there. I think about her all the time, I guess one day we will run towards each other in slow motion and I wear a suede jacket.",Barney
12331,Tell her how you feel?,Marshall
12332,"No. Perhaps. Ever. I know not. Listen... I just need to get rid of that idiot PJ. If Lily was there, she would know how to get rid of him.",Barney
12333,I can perhaps help you.,Marshall
12334,"You're not Lily. Lily is a diabolical puppet master, the subtle situations to achieve its ends. This is evil incarnate. You have the right. Cling to it.",Barney
12335,I was going to do my walk with wisdom. Want to go?,Ted
12336,I took the key to the toilet without asking. Are you gonna do?,Robin
12337,"Hire the kid as his assistant. He does all the work and you're still Sports-man. Evil incarnate, Eriksen. Evil incarnate.",Barney
12338,Are you okay?,Robin
12339,And if I did not think the books?,Ted
12340,Sorry?,Robin
12341,"There is a history of architecture on a famous architect who designed the library. She was perfect. But every year, sinking a few inches into the ground. Obviously, the building was condemned. He forgot to take into account the weight of books. This box... it's just me. If I ever thought not to books?",Ted
12342,"No one goes to the library, so you do not care of this type. And you must pick up the phone and call customers.",Robin
12343,"The more I delayed the launch of my box, the more it can remain a dream and not something that I screwed up. It's like if I quit before it began.",Ted
12344,"You wanna talk drop? I described as the perfect guy &quot;funny, intelligent, passionate, ambitious.&quot; And apparently, I just... &quot;In my apartment.&quot; You thought that you would have understood, now?",Robin
12345,"Are you kidding? At 30, I had to have an insolent success, being married to the perfect woman, maybe a kid on the way. Instead, I'm just a guy sitting in his apartment, which is a competition look with his phone. And who loses.",Ted
12346,You can do it.,Robin
12347,"Hello, Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. I learn about your design needs, present or future.",Ted
12348,It looks good.,Robin
12349,I looked confident?,Ted
12350,Now known as a real customer.,Robin
12351,Great.,Ted
12352,"Hey, Chow-man!",Marshall
12353,"Hey, Toy-man!",Barney
12354,Who's this guy?,Marshall
12355,He is not here. I think we should leave.,Barney
12356,Really?,Marshall
12357,It's happened before.,Barney
12358,Super. So I'll call you.,Ted
12359,Look at this.,Marshall
12360,I had the number of that girl. Look. Holly.,Ted
12361,"Owl. The girls with a name ending in LY are dirty.Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily.",Barney
12362,"Yeah, it's true.",Marshall
12363,"And not to mention the girls with names ending in I instead of a Y. These girls are like rides. You make the long tail, but once inside, you hold on, hoping not to lose your keys.",Barney
12364,You know what I'm going to do? I'll call on. I will do &quot;you remember me? It's been a &quot;. It's funny because I just saw.,Ted
12365,You can not. You must wait three days before calling.This is the rule.,Barney
12366,"This rule is completely outdated. They know exactly what you do. I have another rule. It's a bit crazy, but I call it, &quot;you like him, you call him.&quot;",Ted
12367,Sorry. Can you repeat that? I do not mean the f*ck.,Barney
12368,"My rule of three days, it is anything. Who invented it?",Ted
12369,Jesus.,Barney
12370,"Barney, do not do that. Not with Jesus.",Marshall
12371,"Seriously. Jesus began this thing for three days. He waited three days to return to life. It was perfect. If he had waited one day we would not have known he was dead! They would have said: &quot;Jesus, are you? &quot;And Jesus would probably have said,&quot; You okay? I died yesterday! &quot;And they would say:&quot; You have the air alive, man. &quot; And they should explain his resurrection. And the miracle. And then the guy would say, &quot;Okay, whatever you want, dude.&quot;",Barney
12372,The dialogues seem pompous old now.,Robin
12373,"And he will not come back on a Saturday. Everyone is busy doing chores. Weave, cut the beard. No. It looked exactly the right number of days... Three.",Barney
12374,"I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking.",Ted
12375,"And it's Sunday, they are all already in the church.They are all there, &quot;No, Jesus died.&quot; Then, bam! He burst through the door, crossed the aisle, everyone is excited. And by the way, that's where he invented the &quot;tope there! &quot;3 days.We wait three days to call a woman because it is the time that Jesus wants us to wait. True story.",Barney
12376,Okay. I promise. I will call not before three days.,Ted
12377,What was that?,Robin
12378,What?,Ted
12379,You made a noise.,Robin
12380,"This is my laptop, a text message.",Ted
12381,Not that. You made the sound of the naked girl.,Robin
12382,What?,Ted
12383,"When you see a naked girl, you make noise.",Robin
12384,That's not true.,Ted
12385,Really?,Robin
12386,"Sorry, Lily.",Ted
12387,It's a breast.,Ted
12388,This is Holly who writes to you? You're not promised to wait three days?,Robin
12389,"To call. Texting, it's different.",Ted
12390,"Okay, just try to proclaim your sound of the naked girl.",Robin
12391,I make no noise.,Ted
12392,Really?,Robin
12393,Holly just told me what she wears. It's pretty exciting.,Ted
12394,"Whatever it is, I guarantee you she do not wear it. She lies to please you.",Robin
12395,How do you know?,Ted
12396,"Because no woman in history has never, &quot;asked to read architectural magazines in my old... uniform cheerleader. &quot;",Robin
12397,"Okay, maybe she's lying on the architectural magazines.No. This is bad.",Ted
12398,What?,Robin
12399,She just sent me a message clearly intended for someone else.,Ted
12400,"&quot;Baby, I got to eat at Generro. I come home soon. &quot;Yes, it sounds bad, but thinking a little. It is perhaps for his brother or father who is ill.",Robin
12401,Come down.,Ted
12402,&quot;And then I want to... you to take me on the couch.&quot;Maybe not a sick father. Father or a really sick... Right? Sorry.,Robin
12403,Hi guys! What is it?,Robin
12404,A meal that I Generro back to Lily.,Marshall
12405,Bizarre. Holly sent a message to Ted talking about a meal Generro. A second. Band of bastards!,Robin
12406,What?,Barney
12407,You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you?,Robin
12408,"We knew he would try to call three days before, so I took his cell phone and changed his number from mine.",Barney
12409,"We wanted to call the chopper too early, but then he... sent text messages.",Marshall
12410,&quot;Piti texting&quot;?,Barney
12411,"Poor, little Ted. It should... He should say it estnous.",Marshall
12412,Yeah. Or... it pretends to Holly and we are in the bath.,Barney
12413,It's better. It was funny. He should say that it is us.,Marshall
12414,It should. Or... it is said that red is our favorite color and found the look &quot;cowboy&quot; sexy.,Barney
12415,It's better.,Marshall
12416,I wear them right now and they are very sexy.,Ted
12417,He put the boots!,Barney
12418,He bluntly put! It was great! But it's time to tell him that he wears.,Marshall
12419,Or... we remove our shirts.,Barney
12420,It's better.,Marshall
12421,"Maybe that door below, a black bra with lace.",Barney
12422,I believe that wearing anything underneath.,Marshall
12423,It is hot.,Barney
12424,"There, he wears only cowboy boots! Here we go!",Marshall
12425,Too! Tell him we slowly drag our... What do we do?,Barney
12426,I think we'll... have sex with Ted.,Marshall
12427,You did this all day? This is wicked.,Robin
12428,"No, actually it was for his good. It protects it from itself. He really likes this girl. He had that look.",Marshall
12429,"The crazy eyes, &quot;I'm going too fast and I will f*ck up everything.&quot;",Barney
12430,The same he had with you the first time.,Marshall
12431,We all know what it gave.,Barney
12432,I'm in love with you.,Ted
12433,What?,Robin
12434,"I was a single case. This is not Holly Robin Scherbatsky. What is wrong with her hair? News Flash: detangling, it exists for not having a helmet. I'm so mean.",Robin
12435,It's been that Ted did not like someone. He stored much... We thought him to say &quot;I love you&quot; when he contacted her.,Marshall
12436,And it's coming. It shows all the telltale signs.,Barney
12437,First: he jokes with the marriage.,Marshall
12438,&quot;You like architecture? We should get married. Ha-ha.MDR. Just kidding. So what? &quot;,Barney
12439,Deuzio: it's far too early suggestions crazy travel.,Marshall
12440,&quot;I like beer. We should go to Germany. MDR. JP.MDR. &quot;,Barney
12441,Third: it says too early personal things.,Marshall
12442,&quot;My parents divorced two years there. It was really hard. MDR. &quot;,Barney
12443,And he really knows not what means MDR.,Robin
12444,"Yeah, but that's the problem. Ted did not say &quot;I love you&quot; as easily as we thought.",Marshall
12445,And then we met Stan.,Barney
12446,"So, he explained everything and once finished, there was something fascinating.",Marshall
12447,Super Stan. Who is it?,Robin
12448,A guard who works nights.,Barney
12449,He eats here every day.,Marshall
12450,And he had not finished.,Barney
12451,Far from it.,Marshall
12452,It's... really nice.,Marshall
12453,No matter. It's OK.,Barney
12454,You want me to send it to Ted. I knew it.,Marshall
12455,"I do not know... what comes to the bread here, but it touches me... here... and here.",Marshall
12456,"Well, if Ted does not say, I will. I love you.",Barney
12457,It is perhaps not in love with us.,Marshall
12458,How is this possible? It's all there waiting!,Barney
12459,I do not understand men.,Marshall
12460,Do... you come back?,Marshall
12461,That guy you fell in love. I hope his girlfriend is not jealous. He spoke of a friend or...?,Robin
12462,All was well until he sends a text message for Lily and ruins everything.,Barney
12463,"It's okay. It's over now. I have to leave, but that's what happens: you call it now, tell him what you did and apologize.Got it?",Robin
12464,Yes. (Barney out of the bar) Or...,Barney
12465,"Holly explained everything to me, it was just a misunderstanding. All is well now.",Ted
12466,Really? How she explained the scope of texting?,Robin
12467,"Apparently, his idiot friend of Marsha accidentally used his phone for a message to her husband Billy.",Ted
12468,Marsha and Billy. They are not trampled.,Robin
12469,"And now I feel better than ever. It sounds crazy, but I think that I am attached to this girl.",Ted
12470,You cling to Barney and Marshall.,Robin
12471,What?,Ted
12472,"They did not believe that you'd wait three days, so Barney has changed his number by that of his work laptop.Holly is Barney and Marshall.",Robin
12473,"Wait. It was them all along? So Holly was not in his bath?Or sitting by the window, gazing at the stars thinking of me? Or on his couch cheerleader reading architecture magazines?",Ted
12474,I think they have done that. They were just at the bar.,Robin
12475,It's true.,Ted
12476,"Yes, it was them.",Robin
12477,Incredible!,Ted
12478,I know. You should tell them that you are not fooled.,Robin
12479,Or... I send them a text message that will really confuse them.,Ted
12480,"I see. Why not: &quot;I have told anyone yet, but I only have three months to live&quot;?",Robin
12481,"Not bad. And: &quot;I k*ll a man with a shovel, and those feelings resurface&quot;?",Ted
12482,I love this thing someone said about three months to live.,Robin
12483,&quot;I've never told anyone but I slept with the mother of my best friend. &quot;,Ted
12484,"It's good, but I think it comes down to trick the three months to live.",Robin
12485,Wait. I think I have.,Ted
12486,"He replied! &quot;I probably should not tell you, finally, we barely knew, but never mind, I say it anyway. &quot;",Marshall
12487,"That's it, man. This is the &quot;I love you.&quot;",Barney
12488,I would like Stan to be there.,Marshall
12489,Stan. What?,Barney
12490,&quot;I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend.&quot;,Marshall
12491,&quot;I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend. &quot;,Barney
12492,"Ted Why send text messages to a girl he barely knows, where he says he dreams about me gay?",Marshall
12493,Easy. You? He speaks clearly to me.,Barney
12494,"Dude, I'm his best friend.",Marshall
12495,"Okay, one: It has never been proven. Two: If anyone had any dreams about gays one of us would be on me! Finally, look at me. Now look at you. An octogenarian still in her closet would not be in this state.",Barney
12496,"That's the trick. I hug you, no. Who would not want to cuddle in this case, on Sunday morning? Wrapped in the quilt while it is raining, and there are muffins in the oven. I'm cuddly, bitch. You must do.",Marshall
12497,I train every day. One thing we know about Ted is that he likes a nice body. This body would vibrate.,Barney
12498,"Ted and I, we lived. I know what he likes. There are things I can do it... he Ã©poustoufleraient Why do they sleep with Ted?",Marshall
12499,I know. It's weird.,Barney
12500,"Crazy, no? Ted had dreams about me gay.",Barney
12501,"And by &quot;me&quot;, he means Marshall Eriksen, star of Ted's gay dreams.",Marshall
12502,"So what? So Ted has gay dreams about one of you. It's not as if he had three months to live. It would... Shocking, no?",Robin
12503,Look at this guy. How is my best friend for 12 years?,Marshall
12504,"It's a bit weird, but... I had a strange dream yesterday. It's a bit embarrassing.",Ted
12505,You can tell us. This is a secure area.,Barney
12506,Your feelings are quite natural.,Marshall
12507,That's what happened.,Ted
12508,"Then at the end of the meal, Frank Gehry addition to the slides and IM Pei said, &quot;Friend, tonight is your name I Paye.&quot;Buckminster Fuller was almost choking. And I woke up.",Ted
12509,That's it?,Marshall
12510,No more dreams? Nothing disturbing or erotic?,Barney
12511,"OK, what do you say that. You know that someday in the future, machines will rebel?",Marshall
12512,Of course.,Ted
12513,"So, the machines... k*ll everyone. And there are only you, me, and Barney. Who among us would you... you?",Marshall
12514,And.. why should I &quot;make me&quot; one of you?,Ted
12515,Machines force you. They want to watch. That's how they erupt.,Barney
12516,"It's hard. I imagine it would be... Holly. Robin told me everything. That's why I invented everything. Guys, here is Holly. And I have not waited for your precious three days to call. I knew where she was working so I found. Let me ask you? It was too early?",Ted
12517,Holly and I are going to dinner.,Ted
12518,Sorry. It was just trying to help you.,Marshall
12519,"And also, it was really funny.",Barney
12520,"I do not need help, OK? I can look after myself. And yes, maybe some girls do not like to be called away or they may say too, but guess what? These are not good for me. Maybe the good is the one that loves me to do that, because... this is who I am and I will not change because of a stupid rule of the Three Days. Holly spells his name with an &quot;I&quot;.",Ted
12521,You work right?,Barney
12522,Great! We can have fun!,Marshall
12523,Yes.,Robin
12524,What...,Barney
12525,Wait. You can not just sit there and have your date with us?,Marshall
12526,"Yeah, it will be fun! Look, I'm kidding! It explodes! Do you like magic?",Barney
12527,You know their names?,Robin
12528,"No, it's Marshall. Married to Lily.",Robin
12529,"A hat? This is brilliant. I love it! Nothing better to say &quot;delicious&quot; as inside a cowboy hat. I tell you, I'm your man. I think being born to draw this building. I... I see.",Ted
12530,I see it. I see it. (Robin enters) What is it good?,Ted
12531,All-Nighter?,Robin

12828,"When Evel Knievel rode his rocket star on the shore of Snake River Canyon, you think his wife said &quot;Honey, come down here '?",Marshall
12829,"For the last time, I'm not Linda Knievel! I will never be Linda Knievel!",Lily
12830,No need to remind me.,Marshall
12831,"Marshall, do not do that. Do not jump, please.",Lily
12832,"Sorry, but I have to.",Marshall
12833,You can not.,Lily
12834,Why?,Marshall
12835,You want a reason? You're going to have one. I am pregnant.,Lily
12836,"My God! My God, really? I saw you look fat...",Marshall
12837,"I was lying, bastard! Go ahead, jump! I hope u gonna die!",Lily
12838,This is the permission I needed.,Marshall
12839,"Look, Robin... I must tell you something.",Barney
12840,"Wait. Before that, I must tell you something.",Robin
12841,What is it?,Barney
12842,I think I love you.,Robin
12843,"This is Ted. Everyone! Ted, are you?",Lily
12844,"She's here, Lily. She looks at me.",Ted
12845,What?,Lily
12846,The goat.,Ted
12847,"It's been an incredible thing. I was talking to Robin, I would tell him my feelings, but just before, you will believe what ever she said.",Barney
12848,I think I love you.,Robin
12849,You said what?,Lily
12850,In your opinion? What we can say to that?,Barney
12851,"Robin, you're great listening. You're really great, but we're friends. This is not a good idea.",Barney
12852,You must be right. Have fun.,Robin
12853,"You too, sweetie.",Barney
12854,What?,Lily
12855,"Once she told me that, more than feelings. I'm more in love.",Barney
12856,"You were in love with her, throughout the year and when she feels the same, you love him more.",Lily
12857,It's not great?,Barney
12858,It's a wuss. Not food. (He takes the mop in the bathroom and closes the door behind him) How...?,Ted
12859,It is. It... is... go! It is.,Marshall
12860,"Tracey, tell Lily what you just said.",Barney
12861,"No, how you've arrived there.",Barney
12862,Come off the bus from Iowa! How lucky that apprentice... dancer off the bus from Iowa... meeting... the producer of the Rockettes?,Barney
12863,"Honey, you're there. You're really there.",Lily
12864,"You can make us one of those rum and beer, that your father loves so much?",Barney
12865,Damn.,Lily
12866,What?,Barney
12867,"Everyone always says, &quot;Do not tell Lily. Lily can not keep a secret. &quot;And, usually, they are right. But this time I kept the secret. And here you come with that crap and you force me to become the Lily will spill the beans!",Lily
12868,What song? There was a piece?,Barney
12869,There was a song.,Lily
12870,The costume is Robin. I know! Okay?,Barney
12871,I'm with you.,Ted
12872,Now. As I explained...,Barney
12873,What...,Ted
12874,Shit.,Robin
12875,He said that? My God! What an incredible surprise!,Lily
12876,You know since when?,Robin
12877,And you've said anything since? Bravo.,Robin
12878,"Bravo, Lily. I mean, what a b*mb. Who saw this coming?",Marshall
12879,You know since when?,Robin
12880,7 months and 29 days.,Marshall
12881,I will do what?,Robin
12882,I know. Are you gonna do?,Lily
12883,I'll marry Barney in a large church. We'll move to New Hampshire and open cottages.,Robin
12884,Really?,Marshall
12885,No! This is Barney. I mean... This is Barney. But it's Barney. I have to say no.,Robin
12886,"Boy, you're going to break her... The thing that this black mud pump through his veins.",Lily
12887,"You're right. For the first time he likes a girl, she pushes him away? And not just any girl. It's going to destroy it.",Robin
12888,"OK, first... Second, there is a trick you can try. It's risky, but it can pay off. Lack of anything better, I'll call it... The Mosby.",Marshall
12889,The Mosby?,Robin
12890,"No, she can not mosbyser.",Lily
12891,It could squarely mosbyser.,Marshall
12892,What is the Mosby?,Robin
12893,"Do you remember your first time with Ted? You wanted to get on the train Ted, visit his yard.",Marshall
12894,I was ready to jump the turnstile.,Robin
12895,What changed everything?,Marshall
12896,I think I love you.,Ted
12897,What?,Robin
12898,The Mosby! It's great! And... excuse me.,Robin
12899,"You're really pretty, but abnormally high and you will not believe in ghosts.",Marshall
12900,"So... when she said love me, she meant... otherwise.",Barney
12901,That's it. It worked well. You are back to normal.,Lily
12902,Yes. It's true. And it's great. It's great. (Tracey returns) So Robin does not like me.,Barney
12903,No.,Lily
12904,Why?,Barney
12905,Mr. Goat? (He tries to open the bathroom but the door is closed) M. The goat? Enough. (He manages to enter) Crazy Goat. I do not understand your fascination with this mop. It should be normal with a brain the size of a...,Ted
12906,"Marshall, you can pick up Ted?",Lily
12907,I was about to jump. You've not heard saying &quot;OK&quot; loop?,Marshall
12908,I'm sorry. Go ahead and jump.,Lily
12909,"It's good. Sorry, everyone. Lily does not want me jumping. (He descends from the rim) Thank God.",Marshall
12910,The hospital!,Ted
12911,What has happened?,Lily
12912,It happened... you left a wild animal in our apartment. I've been attacked.,Ted
12913,This is the sweetest and adorable goat in the world.,Lily
12914,&quot;The sweetest and adorable goat in the world&quot;?,Ted
12915,It's the goat jumped on me! Can I go?,Ted
12916,"Great, I'm late for my presentation. Thank you, Mr. Goat.",Ted
12917,Mr. Goat? It's a girl. Her name is Missy.,Lily
12918,You got b*at by a girl.,Marshall
12919,So... You're in love with me?,Barney
12920,What? Yes. Much.,Robin
12921,You can stop. Lily told me everything.,Barney
12922,"Damn, Lily!",Robin
12923,I can not believe it.,Barney
12924,"It's just... You mean to me, Barney. And... This kind of stuff, the emotional side. This is not your type. I thought you avoid that.",Robin
12925,"Maybe I will not avoid it. I am perhaps. I have not wanted for a long time. But with you, it does not look so...difficult. I know not. I thought... you felt the same.",Barney
12926,"Maybe. I know not. I am not good to face the feelings.There is clearly something... between us. Maybe my head said, &quot;stifles it in the bud&quot; because my heart said... something else. Listen... I feel for you. Maybe even that I love you.",Robin
12927,"It's going pretty fast, do not you think?",Barney
12928,What?,Robin
12929,We're good friends. Why risk everything? Friends?,Barney
12930,Friends.,Robin
12931,My God. You just do it again. You've mosbysÃ©!,Barney
12932,But no.,Robin
12933,"But if, little flirtatious.",Barney
12934,You're right. I've just mosbyser.,Robin
12935,Why are you scared to try?,Barney
12936,Because I'm afraid of how I could love you.,Robin
12937,Bad idea.,Barney
12938,You're right. There must be a mistake.,Robin
12939,No.,Barney
12940,I love you.,Robin
12941,Friends.,Barney
12942,"Friends, then.",Robin
12943,I love you.,Barney
12944,Let's get married.,Robin
12945,"No, you're smothering me.",Barney
12946,"OK, forget it.",Robin
12947,You know what? We'll see later.,Barney
12948,"Yeah, let's go.",Robin
12949,"There he is, gentlemen. Rib Town. Is it not? Is it not?",Ted
12950,What?,Ted
12951,Sven...,Ted
12952,"I'll tell you, I will eat more chops.",Marshall
12953,"Yeah, right.",Barney
12954,I will not eat.. never... chops! Before Ted!,Marshall
12955,It's a disaster. How I will recover?,Ted
12956,"OK, I'm just asking. You really want to recover?",Lily
12957,What does that mean?,Ted
12958,"Architecture is k*ll you and it k*ll us to see her k*ll you.You're like the goat with the mop. You want it so much, and whenever the world try to get the resume, it hooks you. But you know what? This is only a wimp. Why do you want?",Lily
12959,Because I have to be an architect. This is... That's the plan.,Ted
12960,"In the crapper, the plan. I wanted to be a famous artist.Marshall wanted to be environmental lawyer. Robin wanted to be a TV reporter.",Lily
12961,I am a TV reporter. I am on the air at 4am.,Robin
12962,It continues? Bravo.,Lily
12963,"What someone looks, please.",Robin
12964,Barney wanted to be a violinist. Need not tell me. You can not draw your life as a building. It does not work like that. You must live it and draw it to itself.,Lily
12965,"So what, I should do anything?",Ted
12966,Look what the world tells you to do and took the leap.,Lily
12967,"You're right. You're completely right. I love you, Lily.",Marshall
12968,A metaphorical leap. A metaphorical leap!,Lily
12969,I did it!,Marshall
12970,"Honey, you did it!",Lily
12971,I can do anything!,Marshall
12972,It's true!,Lily
12973,I bought a motorcycle!,Marshall
12974,"No, not at all!",Lily
12975,"OK, sorry. Come on, guys.",Marshall
12976,Whoo!!!,Lily
12977,Lily! All we need is your indoor &quot;whoo.&quot;,Robin
12978,"Sorry. (slower) Whoo! It's just they kissed! They're finally a couple. Oh, my God, you guys! This is our first double date! First of millions! What if our kids get married?! Oh I love this!",Lily
12979,"Yeah, Lily, listen.",Barney
12980,Barney's awesome.,Robin
12981,Robin's more than just awe-&quot;some.&quot; She's awe-&quot;quite a bit.&quot; She's awe-&quot;a whole darn lot.&quot;,Barney
12982,"Wait, what are you saying?",Lily
12983,We're just not feeling it right now. But we'll totally still be friends.,Robin
12984,Oh yeah.,Barney
12985,Is it something I did?,Lily
12986,"Oh no, no, no. God, no. Lily, it's not you. It's us.",Robin
12987,"Yeah, It's us. You understand, right?",Barney
12988,"Sure, of course. As long as you're happy, I'm happy.</p><h",Lily
12989,We were gonna take cooking lessons together and we were gonna go on camping trips together and then we were gonna sit around telling funny stories about our cooking lessons and our camping trips.,Lily
12990,(trying to console her) I know. I Know. So... has the boat sailed on sex tonight or...</p><h,Marshall
12991,Wow! What's this?,Ted
12992,It's just a little something that we got for you that used to belong to my favourite professor of all time.,Marshall
12993,A fedora! (he puts it on his head and pulls out a whip) I'm Indiana Jones! I'm Indiana Jones!!,Ted
12994,"That, my friend, is the Dominator 8000, the best bullwhip on the market, according to my whip guy. Yeah, I have a whip guy.",Barney
12995,You know what we should do? We should...,Ted
12996,"Finish our drinks, go out in the alley, and whip stuff.",Marshall
12997,God... you just get me.,Ted
12998,"OK, I should get going. I got a date.",Robin
12999,You're still seeing that guy?,Barney
13000,"Even better, seeing him naked.",Robin
13001,"I should go, too. I hooked up with this Chinese girl last night and I don't know, it's weird. I already feel like seconds.",Barney
13002,"OK Ted, You got first whip!",Marshall
13003,"All right. (imitating Clint Eastwood) Hey, dummy (to a mannequin). What did tell you about smoking in here?",Ted
13004,"Make him whip the habit! I'so excited about this whip! I got whip fever! Just whip him, Ted! Don't even aim! Just whip him!</p><h",Marshall
13005,I'm so sorry.,Ted
13006,"It's just the whip's not a toy. There's such a thing as common sense, you know.",Marshall
13007,You can whip me if you want.,Ted
13008,"I will, some other time.",Marshall
13009,Whoo!!!!!!,Lily
13010,"So, how long has this been going on?",Lily
13011,All summer.,Barney
13012,I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! You guys are boyfriend and girlfriend.,Lily
13013,Girlfriend?,Barney
13014,"Slow your roll there, Lilypad.",Robin
13015,"Yeah, yeah.",Barney
13016,You've been together all summer. I don't get it.,Lily
13017,"Ok, It's like this. After we kissed, we sat down to have the talk.",Robin
13018,We should figure out what this is.,Robin
13019,"Yes, we should. Or. Or...",Barney
13020,"Okay, now, we have to figure this out.",Robin
13021,"Yes, we do. Or. Or...",Barney
13022,We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk.,Robin
13023,"Yeah, the talk sucks. You have to, like, talk. And be all, &quot;I don't know.",Barney
13024,"You needs it. Guys, you can't just keep hooking up and not at least try and figure out what you mean to each other.",Lily
13025,"Yeah, we knew you would say that. That's why we kept it a secret.",Robin
13026,"Well, that and the fact that elaborate lies really turn us on.",Barney
13027,"No, no, no (trying to hold Barney who tries to kiss Robin). You need to define the relationship. You ne to have the talk.",Lily
13028,Or. Or...,Barney
13029,"I know what you're all thinking. Who's this cool peer of mine up in front the class?&quot; I know the board says &quot;Professor Mosby,&quot; but to you I'm Ted.",Ted
13030,Question. Awesome. Hit it.,Ted
13031,They're at home. I...,Ted
13032,"Oh, God.",Ted
13033,"Barney, it was awful. I was teaching...",Ted
13034,"Ted, now's not a good time. Where do you keep your condoms?</p><h",Barney
13035,I am freaking out. I don't think I can do this.,Ted
13036,"Okay, look, mistake number 1 was taking that girl's question. You don't take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Mistake number 2 was you should've hit that. Dude, your pants were already off, you had a classroom full of people to cheer you on, and you can't knock her up 'cause it's a dream. Class dismissed.",Barney
13037,"Mistake number 3, dude, where was the hat? Cause if you're not going to wear it, I'm taking it back.",Marshall
13038,"I think what Barney's saying is that definitions are important. You're their teacher, not their friend.",Lily
13039,Exactly.,Barney
13040,"If people don't know their place, nobody's happy.",Lily
13041,Amen.,Barney
13042,You have to make things clear.,Lily
13043,Run tell that.,Barney
13044,Define the relationship.,Lily
13045,"Yes! No! Lily, private convo time.",Barney
13046,"Lily, can't you just let us be happy?",Barney
13047,You're not happy. You just think you're happy because you feel happy.,Lily
13048,And that's not happy?,Barney
13049,Of course not. You and Robin need to have the talk.,Lily
13050,Why? Give me one good reason.,Barney
13051,I'll give you 20...,Lily
13052,"Waow, You can't even think of one. Headlights. Dear. Lily, for the last time, things with me and Robin are as good as they can possibly be. Oh, hey, look, Brad's here.",Barney
13053,"Euh, oh, hum, heu...",Robin
13054,"Come on, Brad, that's... Wow, There's really six of them. But, I can't.",Robin
13055,"No. No, no boyfriend.",Robin
13056,Hey Brad.,Barney
13057,I just thought of a reason.</p><h,Lily
13058,You're probably wondering why I've been quiet all night.,Robin
13059,"Damn it, Hordichuk! You miss another gimme like that, I'm gonna come down there and put a slapper right up your beerhole! Come on!",Robin
13060,"The truth is, I feel kind of weird being out with you.",Robin
13061,What?,Robin
13062,"No, Brad, no, it's...",Robin
13063,"God, no... Brad, no... This is about me and Barney.",Robin
13064,"Well, we don't know what we are. I mean, my heart says &quot;leap into it.&quot; My brain says &quot;it's a bad idea.&quot;",Robin
13065,We're not gonna have the talk.,Barney
13066,"Would you just have the talk, okay? It's a five-minute conversation, and then you get to have sex afterwards. It's great! Back me up, Ted.",Marshall
13067,I don't think the talk is necessary.,Ted
13068,What?!,Marshall
13069,"Thank you, Ted.",Barney
13070,Because Robin is already his girlfriend.,Ted
13071,What?!,Barney
13072,"MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...",Ted
13073,"How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend? Simple, the rules for girls are the same as the rules for gremlins.",Barney
13074,&quot;Gremlins&quot;?,Ted
13075,"Gremlins. Rule number 1. Never get them wet. In otherords, don't let her take a shower at your place. Number 2. Keep them away from sunlight. I.E. Don't ever see them",Barney
13076,What about brunch? Is brunch cool?,Ted
13077,"No, Ted. Brunch is not cool.",Barney
13078,"OK, new topic. How do I pick a tie?",Ted
13079,Simple. Remember in the movie Predator...,Barney
13080,I've done all three of those things with Robin. Is she my girlfriend?,Barney
13081,"Just once, I wish you guys would call me on Tuxedo Night.</p><h",Marshall
13082,Why not? Lay it on me.,Robin
13083,Hey Brad!,Barney
13084,"Brad, we can't fight like this all night! We both got some good shots in. Let's call a truce!",Barney
13085,"Wow, wow, wow, Girlfriend? Hey, come on.",Barney
13086,That's putting it a bit strongly.,Robin
13087,A bit strongly. She's not my girlfriend.,Barney
13088,"A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay?</p><h",Robin
13089,"Okay, seriously. We're at the point of physical violence. Now, will you please have the talk?",Lily
13090,Because of that? Come on. That's my thing. I'm always punching guys. Girls... I'll punch a baby. I don't care.</p><h,Barney
13091,"(for himself) Wait. Does professor have one &quot;F&quot; or two? Oh, my God... Oh, my God! Professor. Pro-fess-or. They're all staring at me. I don't know. Just do something! Two &quot;F's&quot;. That looks right. I think that's right.",Ted
13092,"Hey, sorry I went little too far last night.",Barney
13093,We've been over this. Unless I say &quot;flugelhorn&quot; you haven't gone too far.,Robin
13094,"No, I meant punching Brad.",Barney
13095,"Right. Look, don't even worry about it. It's...",Robin
13096,"God. The doorknob's broken off. We're locked in here. Did, did you do this?",Robin
13097,No.,Barney
13098,Flugelhorn. Did you do this?,Robin
13099,"(knocking at the door) Ted, are you out there?",Robin
13100,"(sitting behind the door) Ted's not here, Robin.",Lily
13101,"Lily, let us out of here.",Robin
13102,I'd be glad to. Just as soon as you and Barney have the talk.,Lily
13103,Lily! Come on. Let us out!,Robin
13104,"No. Sit down, define the relationship, write down that definition on a piece of paper, slip it under the door, and if I like what I read, you can go.",Lily
13105,We are not having the talk!,Barney
13106,Then you'll die in there.,Lily
13107,"You're gonna lock us in here? Well, guess what? Maybe we'll spend the whole day having sex!",Robin
13108,"Well, guess what? I broughtMarshall with me, so maybe we'll do the same.",Lily
13109,"Hey, guys.</p><h",Marshall
13110,"Good morning. 'Sup, dudes? Silence! This is Architecture 101. I am Professor Mosby. But you can call me Ted. Professor Mosby. T-Dawg. Do not call me T-Dawg.",Ted
13111,"Never take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Also, don't look right here (showing girl's boobs). Okay, good luck. Byesies.",Barney
13112,Please save all your questions until the end of the lecture. Thank you! Now...,Ted
13113,Here's your think-about-it for the day. Every single person in this room... is already an architect.,Ted
13114,(reading): We're just hanging out.&quot;,Marshall
13115,Just hanging out? Not good enough.,Lily
13116,(whipping with the whip) Not good enough!</p><h,Marshall
13117,Can anyone here tell me what this class is really all about?,Ted
13118,"Don't laugh. He's not... He's not entirely wrong. An architect must be economical in his use of space, so... well done. Looks like someone's building towards an A.</p><h",Ted
13119,(reading the new note slipped by Robin) &quot;We're seeing where things are going.&quot;,Marshall
13120,I'll tell you where things aren't doing... out of that bedroom. Not good enough.,Lily
13121,(whipping) Not good enough!</p><h,Marshall
13122,(to a student) You... Why do you want to be an architect?,Ted
13123,"Yes, exactly. It's not something you want to be. It's something you need to be. You don't have a choice, right? None of you has a choice.",Ted
13124,No questions!</p><h,Ted
13125,"(reading the new note) &quot;We're Barnman and Robin.&quot; (he laughs) Come on, you got to admit, that's kind of fun, Lily.",Marshall
13126,Not... good enough.,Lily
13127,(whipping) Not good enough!</p><h,Marshall
13128,"So if any of you have even the slightest inclination to do anything with your life other than become an architect, you're wasting my time and yours. There's the door... You can go. I'm serious. Get out, now.",Ted
13129,Wait... Don't... all leave! Architecture's fun! Look! I brought a hacky sack!,Ted
13130,"Sorry, sir. This is... Architecture 101. Who invited their dad, right?",Ted
13131,"Euh, yeah, but, I'm sure 200 architecture students and their professor all got the room wrong.",Ted
13132,"Kids, out of my way! Sorry. Coming through. Excuse me. Coming through.</p><h",Ted
13133,20 minutes late on your first day? That's rough.,Lily
13134,"Yeah, but here's the funny thing. By that point, I didn't have time to think about what kind of teacher I was going to be. I just got up there and talked about architecture. And it was kind of great.",Ted
13135,"That's awesome, Ted.",Lily
13136,"Congratulations, buddy.",Marshall
13137,Thanks.,Ted
13138,"(from her room) Nice job, Ted.",Robin

13140,"(to Barney) Yeah, I got you, buddy. (to Marshall and Lily) They still haven't had the talk?",Ted
13141,I think I know how to speed things up,Marshall
13142,Not cool!,Robin
13143,"Pancakes, fresh bacon. It is so yummy.",Marshall
13144,"(to Barney) Dude, I'm starving. Let's... Let's just have the stupid talk. Come on.",Robin
13145,Fine. But how do these things even work? What do we say?,Barney
13146,"(reading) Where do you see this relationship going? My God, that sounds so cheesy.",Robin
13147,"I know, right?",Barney
13148,Totally. But hum... Where do you see this relationship going?,Robin
13149,"I don't know. I mean, it's not like I don't like you. I just haven't had a girlfriend",Barney
13150,"Mad? I feel the same way. I suck at relationships. I mean, except with Ted. He really got it right. I know it's a clichÃ©, but... he really ruined me for other men.",Robin
13151,Maybe we should go back to being just friends.,Barney
13152,Maybe. But hum... I don't want to stop having sex.,Robin
13153,"Good. Me, neither.",Barney
13154,Friends isn't gonna work.,Robin
13155,We're not good at being friends. We're not good at being in a relationship. What are we good at?,Barney
13156,I know something we're good at.,Robin
13157,"I don't know. If we're gonna do it again, I'm gonna need some Gatorade...",Barney
13158,"No,not that. Lying. Think about it. We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends. Why not just keep lying?",Robin
13159,Really?,Lily
13160,Really. We sat down. We had the talk. Barney's my boyfriend now.,Robin
13161,"And Robin's my girlfriend. I know it sounds nuts, but it feels good to say.",Barney
13162,"We're both afraid of commitment but... the fact is, we also can't live without each other.",Robin
13163,"And if the alternative is not being together, then it's worth taking this risk 'cause... she's awesome.",Barney
13164,And he's awesome. He looks nice in a suit.,Robin
13165,She can handle her Scotch.,Barney
13166,He's my boyfriend.,Robin
13167,And she's my girlfriend.,Barney
13168,(whipping) Good enough!</p><h,Marshall

13170,"Hook, line, and sinker. We are good.",Barney
13171,"Totally. So, you want to get some breakfast?",Robin
13172,"You know, brunch actually does sound kind of good.",Barney
13173,"Well, lead the way, sweetie pie.",Robin
13174,Flugelhorn?,Barney
13175,"Yeah, that felt wrong.",Robin
13176,"You do realize they were lying, right?",Ted
13177,"No, Ted, they don't realize they weren't lying.</p><h",Lily
13178,Hello. Hello. Good evening. Hello. Don't get up. Didn't we meet on a yacht? Hello.,Marshall

13183,Why?,Lily
13184,"No, I said, &quot;Guess who?&quot;",Barney
13185,I heard you.,Lily
13186,"Yeah, um, isn't it a little early in our relationship to do something that would end our relationship?",Robin
13187,"What? No, what are you talking about? It can be our first double date as couples! And plus, it sounds awesome! Is the original Chewbacca going to be there?",Marshall
13188,"Peter Mayhew, in the fur. Who's with me?",Barney
13189,"Hey, do you think they'll have Wookiee to English dictionaries there? I mean, even just an everyday phrase book would be helpful.",Marshall
13190,"We're not going to the &quot;Origins of Chewbacca&quot; exhibit,Marshall. It's inHouston this year. Everyone knows that. I just wanted to get rid of the girls.",Barney
13191,"Where are you taking me, Barney?",Marshall
13192,"Wait a second, the &quot;Origins of Chewbacca&quot; exhibit's inMontreal this year. Everyone knows that. Where are you taking me?",Ted
13193,My guy in the DA's office scored us front row seats to a lethal injection. But we're still stopping for chili dogs first.,Barney
13194,Stop the cab.,Ted
13195,Where are you taking me?,Marshall
13196,"Barney, why are we here?",Marshall
13197,"Marshall, now that Robin and I are together, I've learned a lot about relationships by watching you and Lily.",Barney
13198,"Thanks, man.",Marshall
13199,You're a terrible couple. Lily has taken all the man out of you. I used to think that's just every relationship. But what I've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the same time.,Barney
13200,"Okay, right. So, if Robin knew that you were here, she would be completely fine with it?",Marshall
13201,"Are you kidding? She'd sprint down here with a purse full of singles and a poncho for the 10:30 Jell-O show. BT-Dub, I called ahead it's lime.</p><h",Barney
13202,"So, Jen, what do you do?",Ted
13203,"I'm an architect. Hopefully, one day, I can use my own humble brush on the masterpiece that isManhattan's skyline.",Ted
13204,"I teach architecture. Get 50% off so, that's pretty sweet.</p><h",Ted
13205,Married!,Marshall
13206,What is wrong with you? You're just looking. It's like fantasizing about other women. It's harmless. Wait. Don't tell me you don't fantasize about other women.,Barney
13207,I do! It's just not that easy.,Marshall
13208,False! I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck's mudflaps. Took me less than a mile.,Barney
13209,"Not everyone is you, okay, Barney? Even when I do start to have a dirty thought like that... it seems so much like cheating on Lily, that I feel guilty. So first, I need to have a different fantasy.",Marshall
13210,"It's time, baby.",Lily
13211,I will never love again.,Marshall
13212,"No,Marshall, you must. And after an appropriate number of years, you should find someone else. Someone like that busty delivery girl from that one time. And plow her like a cornfield.",Lily
13213,"(kissing his hand and looking up and ) This one's for you Lily. (to the delivery girl, opening his shirt) Where do I sign?",Marshall
13214,"And then watch out, because it is on!",Marshall
13215,"That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Dude, Lily gets you in real life She has no business in your fantasies.",Barney
13216,"It's all I know, okay? I can't, I can't help it.",Marshall
13217,"I accept your invitation. Marshall Eriksen, from this day forward, I will be the wingman of your mind. Now, focus on the next dancer. Put Lily completely out of your mind.",Barney
13218,"Ted, we found a stripper who looks exactly like Lily!",Barney
13219,"Yeah, I can't talk right now.",Ted
13220,"I'm speechless, too. Everything's as perky as we've always imagined!",Barney
13221,Stop looking at her.,Marshall
13222,"Uh, look, I got to go. Take a picture.",Ted
13223,"Oh, I will. But first, I'm going to makeMarshall watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant between his wife's tatas.",Barney
13224,(hitting him) I'll k*ll you!</p><h,Marshall
13225,(hanging up his cellular) Sorry about that.,Ted
13226,"Yeah, do you wanna share the oysters?",Ted
13227,Good. 'Cause if you didn't......that would be mighty shellfish.,Ted
13228,That's why it's funny!,Ted
13229,We've been on this exact blind date before.,Ted
13230,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that blind date went too well.",Ted
13231,"Wait, you... You dressur cats up in weird costumes.",Ted
13232,"Oh, my God. Do you realize what this means? Since our first date, we've done a complete lap of all the single people inNew York only to end up back here, with each other.",Ted
13233,"Well, you've got your cats.",Ted
13234,"Wait, I got to ask. Why did you think I was snobby?",Ted
13235,"Main Lobster. They spelled &quot;Maine&quot; without the &quot;e.&quot; Good to know we're not getting the crappy understudy lobsters, right? Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half lobster will be played by...",Ted
13236,Huh. I had no idea.,Ted
13237,"That's right-- the check. The check came and, of course, I was going to pay, but you didn't do the check dance.",Ted
13238,"This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. 'Cause let's be honest, we are scaring people off, Jen.",Ted
13239,Great.,Ted
13240,I think we went to MacLaren's.,Ted
13241,You will not believe who we saw tonight.,Barney
13242,"Dude, um...",Marshall
13243,We saw the third doppelganger!,Barney
13244,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! (showing a girl who spits on the ground)",Barney
13245,"Ladies, meet Stripper Lily. (showing a photo in his cellular)",Barney
13246,Oh!,Lily
13247,"Yeah, I couldn't get her face in it. But she looks just like you.",Barney
13248,So you went to a strip club?,Lily
13249,Busted.,Barney
13250,And there was a stripper who looked exactly like me?,Lily
13251,"Okay, babe, look, before you get mad, let me...",Marshall
13252,"Awesome! I bet the guys were going crazy. Oh, I bet they wanted to touch her so bad. But all you can do is look, unless you go into the back room, but honey, you got to pay for that.",Lily
13253,So... Strip club.,Robin
13254,Marshall made me go.</p><h,Barney
13255,"All right, so what did I do wrong next? Let me have it. I'm here to learn.",Ted
13256,Not really.,Ted
13257,I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that.,Ted
13258,I couldn't admit I was cold. I didn't want to seem like a wimp compared to your action hero ex-boyfriend who you wouldn't stop talking about.,Ted
13259,I had an aunt in the Coast Guard.,Ted
13260,See? Why didn't you lead off with that?</p><h,Ted
13261,Was there a shower on stage? Sometimes there's a shower on stage. I bet stripper me would get in there with another girl and just go bananas.,Lily
13262,"See,Marshall? We got to have a bros' night at a strip club and both of our ladies are totally cool with it.",Barney
13263,I'm not cool with it.,Robin
13264,Because they understand that it's healthy for us to do that from time to time.,Barney
13265,It's disgusting.,Robin
13266,Because it's harmless.,Barney
13267,Did one of your whores tell you that?,Robin
13268,"And, Lil,Marshall shouldn't have to go to so much trouble just to have an innocent fantasy.",Barney
13269,Trouble? What trouble?,Lily
13270,"It's, no, it's nothing.",Marshall
13271,"Marshall, tell her. We're all friends here.",Barney
13272,"No, we're not.",Robin
13273,"Lily, Sometimes I think about other women. Okay, it happens. But even when I do, I feel so guilty that I have to imagine you... passing away first, because even in a fantasy world, I could never cheat on you. You're... you're just my life, baby. And I love you.",Marshall
13274,"You k*ll me off?! I mean, fantasize about other girls all you want, but could you maybe not m*rder me?!",Lily
13275,"m*rder?! No! I, baby-no. You develop a chronic illness! I spare no expense for your care! I even stand up a foundation in your name. We're, like, this close to a cure.</p><h",Marshall
13276,Remember? (showing the Mc Laren's bar),Ted
13277,You loved them.,Ted
13278,"Let's go in and see what they remember. And they are my best friends, so don't be surprised if they suddenly &quot;can't think&quot; of anything I do wrong.",Ted
13279,Did he juggle? Bad puns? Mmm. Expect a standing ovation for picking up a $19 check,Robin
13280,"Oh, let's not forget the menu typo gold mine. Keep pannin' that river, buddy.",Lily
13281,"Well, it is a lot cheaper than buying a condom. Oh!",Marshall
13282,Me?,Ted
13283,What about Cat Woman?,Lily
13284,Psst! Ted! (showing a girl with his head),Barney
13285,(looking at the girl) Nice.,Ted
13286,"Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! I remember that. I was not checking out a girl.",Ted
13287,Nice.,Ted
13288,We were checking out Moustache Marshall.,Ted
13289,"Yeah, well, it's nice to know &quot;past me&quot; wasn't a total jackass, huh?",Ted
13290,You got it.,Ted
13291,"...and there's theChryslerBuilding. And the Empire State Building. And at 12:00, a rotund couple going at it against the glass.",Ted
13292,"Good for them. Letting a guy eat pizza off your back, that's love. So, um... I know this wasn't the best",Ted
13293,That was really great. Wh... What went wrong?,Ted
13294,"Yeah. So would you maybe, um... want to go out again?",Ted
13295,Absolutely.,Ted
13296,Promise.,Ted
13297,I have been so busy.,Ted
13298,"Jen, I sorry. Look, I know I'm seven years late with this call, but I was an idiot back then. You saw the goatee. The truth is, I had a great time tonight, and I'd love to see you again.",Ted
13299,"Baby... You should be able to fantasize about another woman without feeling guilty, or you know, k*ll me off.",Lily
13300,"All right, we got to fix this.</p><h",Lily
13301,"Okay, when Stripper Lily gets out here, you have my permission to fantasize about her. And since she's basically me, maybe you won't feel guilty.",Lily
13302,"Thanks, baby. I'm-I'm so lucky I have you. And stripper you.",Marshall
13303,Bring out Stripper Lily!,Lily
13304,"(to Robin) You know, I don't come here that much.",Barney
13305,"Thank you, kindly stranger.",Barney
13306,"I am hot! Oh, crawl for it, stripper me.I is awesome. Baby, can I get another hundred?",Lily
13307,That was a hundred?,Marshall
13308,"Wow, she crawls fast.</p><h",Lily
13309,"Look, Jen, I wish I could go back and talk some sense into 2002 Ted, but that guy's a lost cause. He's 24. He thinks a little facial hair makes him look like John Depp. And he has no idea what a great girl he's missing out on. But I've learned a lot since then. I've learned a lot tonight.",Ted
13310,"No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently... who knows what",Ted
13311,Wow.</p><h,Marshall
13312,You are the best. My girlfriend is at a strip club with me and she couldn't care less.,Barney
13313,"I do care, Barney. Look, we're dating now, okay? That changes things. We have to have a serious talk about this.",Robin
13314,Just the best.,Barney
13315,"Hey. Girlfriend trouble? I wish I could help, but my unbelievably cool wife just bought us a private dance with her stripper body double. So if you need me, I'll be getting grinded like some pepper, in theChampagne room.",Marshall
13316,Just the best.</p><h,Barney
13317,I just remembered why I didn't call you.,Ted
13318,"I can't believe I'm gonna screw this up again, but, um... I like finding typos in menus.",Ted
13319,And I know my shellfish pun is stupid but the truth... I'm not suddenly gonna stop making stupid jokes.,Ted
13320,"Shouldn't we hold out for the person who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks, but actually kind of likes them? Even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other, seven years from now?",Ted
13321,"Well... good luck out there, Jen.",Ted
13322,"Hey, Lil. Looks like, uh, Jasmine's having a hard time getting out of those boots.",Marshall
13323,"(smoking and looking weird) What did you say, buddy?",Lily
13324,Lily?,Marshall

13337,Barney. This is not a one-night stand. We're dating. Come back to bed.,Robin

13344,"Shh, shh, shh. What you need to do is talk through this stuff.",Barney
13345,"Oh, thanks.",Robin

13374,"Well, that doesn't prove anything.",Lily
13375,Yes. Proof. Go word. I'm glad you brought that up. Barney's briefcase. He forgot it here this morning. (taking Barney's briefcase).,Robin

13377,"We, we-- you and I-- are going to open it up and look for evidence. Ted probably has a sledgehammer around here somewhere.",Robin
13378,"No! Stop! Stop! Eye contact. Listen to me. Robin Scherbatsky is many things: friend, confidant, occasional guest star in some confusing dreams that remind me a woman's sexuality is a moving target. But she is no crazy, jealous stalker-bitch. (snatching the briefcase) Let go.",Lily
13379,"Hey, I've been down in the basement storage area going through all the stuff that Lily and I left behind when we moved out. I'm Robin. We should've cleared it out for you much sooner.",Marshall

13383,What the hell is that?,Robin

13386,(slowly) Barrel resin?,Robin
13387,Just go with it.,Lily
13388,So you need a hand throwing it out?,Robin
13389,"No, I'm not... I'm not just going to throw her out, okay? Mabel's like family.",Marshall
13390,"So, um, what are you gonna do with Mabel?",Robin
13391,"I want to give her away, um, to a lucky new owner. Do you know anyone?",Marshall
13392,"Yeah, hmm, let me think. Do I know any rodeo clowns? Oh, that's weird, I do. But even Lenny wouldn't go near that mess.",Robin
13393,"Well, he's not going to have the chance, because I am putting old Mabel in the Bermuda Triangle.",Marshall
13394,This is so exciting. Right now there's some out there who has no idea that tonight they're going home with just... just the best barrel.,Marshall
13395,"Well, let's just hope they're not allergic to barrel sin like Lily here.",Robin
13396,"(to Robin) Be cool, baby. Damn! (toMarshall who is leaving with his barrel) See you, sweetie. Good luck.",Lily

Age: 29, but tells people that she's 26.&quot; Oh, my God,these are notes about me. Or some 29-year-old version of me.",Robin

13404,"She's still there! Okay Mabel, let's find you a new home. Here comes a guy! And he... he just walked, walked right on by it. He's probably rushing home to get a handcart or something. Yeah! Hey, better hurry up, pal. What are you guys doing with Barney's secret Robin notebook? Let me rephrase that. Did you two ladies lose some weight?",Marshall

13409,Why is Ted teaching a class about me? It all started a few weeks ago.,Robin
13410,...rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!,Barney
13411,"Stinson back in. Say, hypothetically, I did want to change who I am to become a better boyfriend to Robin, which I do not! What kind of changes are we talking about?",Barney
13412,"Why, I mean, there's just so much you need to know about her. Okay, for starters, don't ever cry in front her.",Ted
13413,Okay.,Barney
13414,"And whatever you do, don't cry in front of her four times.",Ted
13415,"Hey, guys. What you talking about?",Robin
13416,"They realized they couldn't talk about this stuff at the bar, and since you live with Ted, they had to find someplace safe. So... Ted's classroom.</p><h",Marshall
13417,"&quot;How To Date Robin Scherbatsky.&quot; Lesson one. Now, even though she puts up a tough exterior, what Robin really wants, deep down...",Ted
13418,I'm bored.,Barney
13419,You said you wanted my help.,Ted
13420,Can we draw boobs on the chalkboard?,Barney
13421,We did that ready.,Ted
13422,"No, like, really big boobs.",Barney
13423,"No. Look, I need this, too. I've only been a professor a few weeks. Being up here, it's, it's good practice for me.",Ted
13424,Can we have class outside?,Barney
13425,No! What Robin really wants deep down...,Ted
13426,Barney!,Ted
13427,What? I'm tweeting about you. You should be flattered. How do you spell blah-blah-blah- &quot;H's&quot; or no?,Barney
13428,"Wow, you were just, like, the worst student in the world, weren't you?",Ted
13429,They said I had A-D... something. Can we have class outside?,Barney
13430,"Barney, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up. I love you and I love Robin. And I want to make this work. So if you give me a few weeks of attention, I could give you a lifetime of happiness. Can you do that for me?",Ted
13431,Do you think I should get Sports Illustrated for 70% off the cover price? Can we have class outside? I got to find a way to reach this kid.,Barney
13432,(reading) &quot;Class number two.&quot;,Lily
13433,&quot;Top Ten Robin Scherbatsky Facial Expressions and Their Meaning.&quot;,Robin
13434,"Now, notice the vacant eyes, the pale, queasy expression, suggesting nausea. What do these mean?",Ted
13435,You guys just had sex? Oh! Wasn't me.,Barney
13436,"Dude! I worked really hard on these slides, okay? Can we just...",Ted
13437,Okay.,Barney
13438,"This look is hunger. If you ever see Robin looking like this, get some food in her quick,or one of two things will happen. One: weird, out-of-context laughter. (changing the photo) Or two: spontaneously falling to sleep in strange places. But the most important facial expression of all?",Ted
13439,That's a building.,Barney
13440,Oh... (chuckling) That's for my class. TheFlatironBuilding. Fun story about it. It was designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style; this architectural gem...,Ted
13441,Dude!,Barney
13442,Right. The most important facial expression of all.,Ted
13443,Whoa...,Barney
13444,"Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. If you ever, ever see this face, Barney, run. And don't take a picture of it. She will punch you. And you will cry... for the third time... that night. Which brings us to an important point: defusing the b*mb.",Ted
13445,&quot;Defusing the b*mb&quot;? What does that even mean?,Robin

13449,One. &quot;Vancouver Canucks 2004 Division Title.&quot;,Ted

13451,Two: &quot;Proper g*n Cleaning and Maintenance.&quot;,Ted
13452,"You have to clean your g*n. My uncle had a filthy old g*n, blew both his thumbs off trying to sh**t a beaver. You want to distract someone, make them watch my uncle try to eat corn on the cob.",Robin
13453,Three: &quot;Emperor Penguins.&quot;,Ted
13454,"Did you know that before intercourse, the male and female emperor penguins bow to each other? Mr. Penguin (bowing). Mrs. Penguin (boxing). Oh, God, silly penguins, acting all fancy. ( she laugs) What were we talking about?",Robin
13455,"Neither can you, sweetie.",Lily
13456,"Well, he doesn't know that, baby! God!",Marshall
13457,Ted's only teaching Barney horrible things about me.,Robin
13458,I don't know. Check this out. This is actually kind of sweet.,Lily
13459,"Now, we all know Robin's not what you'd call &quot;touchy-feely.&quot; She doesn't say, &quot;I love you,&quot; like a normal person. Instead, she'll laugh, shake her head, give you a little smile and say, &quot;You're an idiot.&quot;",Ted
13460,&quot;You're an idiot&quot;?,Barney
13461,"Yup. If she tells you you're an idiot, you're a lucky man. And if she does say &quot;I love you,&quot; she's already broken up with you in her mind.",Ted

13466,"Oh, yeah...lefty like that.",Ted

13474,Barney! Do you have a problem with this class?,Ted
13475,"Yeah, it's boring as hell and I'm not learning anything.",Barney
13476,"Uh, well, maybe the problem is your attitude. You're not listening to a word I say.",Ted
13477,"Uh-huh. Uh, can you hear this, Professor? (showing is thumb down) Or should I turn it up for you? (he turns it up).",Barney
13478,"Oh, you think you're not learning anything, huh? Okay. Pop quiz.",Ted
13479,What...,Barney
13480,"When Robin's PMS-ing, what kind of chocolate should you get her?",Ted
13481,Trick question. Get her butterscotch.,Barney
13482,Correct! Why?,Ted
13483,Butterscotch is to Canadian women what chocolate is to American women.,Barney
13484,Correct! What is Robin's dream job?,Ted
13485,To become the most successful female TV journalist of all time.,Barney
13486,"Correct! And if she achieves that, will she truly be happy?",Ted
13487,"No! Robin's deep-seated need for attention can traced back to her father's emotional distance, and no amount of success will ever make up for what she truly needs, which is six simple words from her Dad: &quot;Robin, I'm proud of you, eh?&quot;",Barney
13488,Yes! But I guess you're right. You haven't learned anything. Sorry to have wasted your time.,Ted
13489,"&quot;Oh, Captain! My Captain!&quot;",Barney
13490,How good was Dead Poet's Society?,Ted
13491,"I know, right? The end? Tears.",Barney
13492,"(closing the book) Okay, can I just say that my deepest need in life not to have my father to say, &quot;I am proud of you, eh?&quot;",Robin
13493,So why are you crying now?,Marshall
13494,I'm not crying.,Robin
13495,"(hugging her) Oh, sweetie. Can I get you some butterscotch?",Lily
13496,"Oh, stop it.",Robin
13497,Wait a second. It says here that the class meets at 6:15 on Tuesday.,Robin
13498,So?,Lily
13499,That's right now.,Robin
13500,"Now, as you can see, well over 50% of the blankets have been dragged onto her side. Make no mistake. Robin Scherbatsky is a classic, textbook... cover hog. Any questions?",Ted
13501,"Yeah, I have one.",Robin
13502,"Yes, Robin?",Ted
13503,"(to barney) Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. Uh-oh.",Ted
13504,"I got this. So, emperor penguins-- crazy, huh?",Barney
13505,What the hell do you two think you're doing?,Robin
13506,"Marshall, did you sells out?",Barney
13507,"I was vulnerable, I said good-bye to a very dear friend today.",Marshall
13508,"Dude, it's a barrel!",Robin
13509,Aw! You're giving Mabel away?,Ted
13510,I have so many questions. Why would you do this? What were you thinking? Who the hell is that guy? (showing a guy in the classroom).,Robin
13511,"Oh, that's Shin-Ya. He's sort of been auditing the class.",Ted
13512,&quot;Auditing&quot;?,Robin
13513,"Well, tried to explain to him it wasn't a real class, but I don't think he speaks much English.",Ted
13514,"On the bright side, he came in handy standing in for you during the role-playing exercises.",Barney
13515,Wait. You did role-playing exercises where I was played by Shin-Ya?,Robin
13516,"You know, I can't believe you, Ted. You actually think you're some kind of an expert on me?",Robin
13517,Hey! He is an expert. He's a great teacher!,Barney
13518,(sneezing): Kiss ass.,Lily
13519,"You know, half the stuff in this notebook is patently wrong.",Robin
13520,"Uh, really? Name one wrong thing.",Ted
13521,"&quot;Robin Scherbatsky's Surprising Erogenous Zones&quot;? Let me clear something up for you, Ted.",Robin
13522,Does lefty like that?,Ted
13523,(embarassed) Oh. Yeah...,Robin
13524,Don't wanna leave out the righty.,Ted
13525,"Oh, uh, no. Um, the right one's ticklish, I guess. But the left one, yeah, I'm glad you're back there. Because that is just some sweet, sweet lovin'.",Robin
13526,Noted.,Ted
13527,That was a lie?,Ted
13528,We had just started dating. I was being nice.,Robin
13529,"(to Barney) And you. You know, I got it into my head this week that you were cheating on me. I even broke open your briefcase to look for evidence.",Robin
13530,That is a huge violation of my privacy! Go on.,Barney
13531,"You know, in a way, I was right. You cheated. You can't get some crib sheet on dating me. That's not how it works. If we didn't figure out how to be with each other in a real, honest way, I don't see the point of even trying.",Robin
13532,What do you want?,Robin
13533,Look. All that stuff I told Barney... It was personal between you and me. I'm really sorry.,Ted
13534,I guess I'm impressed by how much you remembered.,Robin
13535,"It's funny. When you date someone, it's like you're taking one long course in who that person is and then, when you break up, all that stuff becomes useless. It's the emotional equivalent of an English degree. I guess I just liked the idea of putting all my Robin Scherbatsky knowledge to good use, you know?",Ted
13536,"Well, since you know me pretty well... am I fooling myself with this whole Barney thing?",Robin
13537,"I don't know. I will say this, though. I've seen Barney work very hard to get women. I've seen him work very hard to get rid of women. I've never seen him work this hard to keep one around. I was going to give him an A. Well, B+ -- Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve.</p><h",Ted
13538,"Hey. Before you say anything, I am done with this stupid Robin 101, okay? Here, I'll get rid of the notebook. (he throws it on the barrel) But there's... there's something that I did want to say to you. Robin, I have been with a lot of women, blondes, brunettes, redheads, big boobs, small",Barney
13539,You're an idiot.,Robin
13540,You know...,Robin
13541,Hmm?,Barney
13542,"That notebook, um, does contain a lot of personal info, and I think it has my home address.",Robin
13543,And your work address.,Barney
13544,Whoa.,Barney
13545,"Designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style, this architectural gem was the first of its kind...",Ted
13546,"Yes, Susan?",Ted

13548,"Ah, tweed. Textile of the eunuch.",Barney
13549,"You know, I've always wondered why those tweed jackets have elbow patches.",Marshall
13550,"Because the people who wear them are constantly going, &quot;Aw, geez, why can't I get laid?&quot;",Barney
13551,You are wrong. The ladies dig the professor look.,Ted
13552,"You know, there is something to that. I remember thinking my tenth grade math teacher was very sexy. I wonder if Harold's still in jail. What? Tax evasion. Among other things.",Robin
13553,"So guys, Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place for a little couples' night.",Lily
13554,"Uh, sure. Why not?",Robin
13555,Welcome.,Lily
13556,(holding a tray)Gouda?,Marshall
13557,"This is great. We're having fun. You're having fun, right?",Lily
13558,"So, should we just go ahead and lock the four of us in for new year's?",Marshall
13559,Right. Sorry. We're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's talk Thanksgiving.,Marshall
13560,Our parents really want to meet you!,Lily
13561,"Wait. But, wait, if you leave now, Colonel mustard just gets away with it.",Marshall
13562,(blocking their way) There's still pie.,Lily
13563,Tonight was fantastic. We should do it again.,Marshall
13564,(flashback when she saw Robin and Barney kissing) Wohoo!,Lily
13565,Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place for a little couples' night.,Lily
13566,"Um, sure, why not?",Robin
13567,Okay. Game time. Let's review the flow of the room. (moving in the room) Barney and Robin enter here. Stop here for margaritas. That's a great conversation starter. We can tell them about nour trip to Cabo.,Lily
13568,"Great, 'cause I got that story about Sammy Hagar Anthe Belgian waffle locked and loaded.",Marshall
13569,"Then we'll move on to the hot apps station. And, depending on how things are going, Some lively pre-dinner charades.",Lily
13570,"Right, but, uh, we'll play that one by... (showing his ears)",Marshall
13571,Sounds like?,Lily
13572,"Okay, you can be Robin's partner.",Marshall
13573,"Oh... Baby, we can do this.",Lily
13574,Welcome.,Lily
13575,Gouda?</p><h,Marshall
13576,"No, you've just got to make it fun. For example, uh, every time I spot a grammatical error, I do a sh*t. I'm trashed right now, and I blame our public school system.",Ted
13577,Take care. Bye.,Lily
13578,Nailed it!,Lily
13579,Best night ever!,Marshall
13580,(in the corridor) Worst night ever.,Barney
13581,"Hey, how was the big couples' night with Marshall and Lily?",Ted
13582,Brutal.,Robin
13583,Really? How?,Ted
13584,"It was like we were on a date with a sad, chubby girl our mom made us call.",Barney
13585,"And they were so nervous, that they weren't even making sense half of the time.",Robin
13586,Hey. Come on in. Would you like a margarita?,Lily
13587,"In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating a Belgian waffle!",Marshall
13588,And they kept shoving platters of food in our faces.,Barney
13589,"Let me guess: Did Marshall get, like, super intense about the cheese?",Ted
13590,"Yeah, how'd you know?",Robin
13591,"Poor Marshall., Lily's this gourmet cook, and all she letsMarshall do ss pick out one sad block of cheese.",Ted
13592,That's prosciutto-wrapped melon.,Lily
13593,You guys are going to want to get in on thisgouda.,Marshall
13594,That's seared scallops with a mango chutney.,Lily
13595,"Seriously, don't sleep on thegouda.",Marshall
13596,And that's Lobster ravioli in a black truffle oil.,Lily
13597,Ooh...Tick-tock goes thegouda clock.,Marshall
13598,"Um, we-we-we didn't realize there was gonna be dinner. We sucked down a couple tacos outside the subway.",Barney
13599,"P.S., not sitting great.",Robin
13600,"And if anything didn't go according to plan, they would freak out.",Barney
13601,"What do you mean, the egg timer is broken? What are we going to use for charades, sweetie?",Lily
13602,"I'm working on it, darling. Okay? Just stall them.",Marshall
13603,"Now, Robin... You work in television. We're experiencing some technical difficulties. ( she laughs): You get that? We're still laughing. Right? Laugh,Marshall.",Lily
13604,"Come on, they just got excited. They've been looking for couple best friends forever. Plus, I'm sure they weren't that bad.",Ted
13605,Show him.,Robin
13606,This is a web siteMarshall already made about last night. (he takes a computer) It's called itwasthebestnightever.com.,Barney
13607,"oh, that's not good.",Ted
13608,"Needless to say, we've both changed our e-mail addresses.",Barney
13609,"I don't understand. If last night went so horribly, why do Lily and Marshall think it was such a hit?",Ted
13610,"I mean, we knew we were gonna have fun tonight, but we had no idea how much.",Barney
13611,Oh.,Marshall
13612,"Yeah, tough luck, every Saturday night I've ever had, 'cause this one just blew you out of the water.",Robin
13613,"Let's do it again, soon.",Barney
13614,"Yeah, we'll call you.",Robin
13615,They're your friends! Why would you just blatantly lie to them like that?,Ted
13616,"Well, that's what you say at the end of a crappy date.",Robin
13617,Right?,Ted
13618,Who was that?,Robin
13619,"Oh, I don't want to brag, But it seems chicks are really digging the whole professor thing. Last night, she picked me up at the bar. And then... Well, she actually wound up falling asleep on the couch. But, hey, that happens.",Ted
13620,"Uh, no, it doesn't.",Barney
13621,"Sure, it does. You know, she was, she was just exhausted from being turned on. But you heard her. She wants to do it again, soon.",Ted
13622,"Ted, let me ask you a question. Where does this girl live, exactly?",Barney
13623,Westchester. Why?,Ted
13624,(he laughs) You're the sexless innkeeper.,Barney
13625,"Oh, my god! You're right! He's totally the sexless innkeeper!",Robin
13626,What the hell is &quot;the sexless innkeeper&quot;?,Ted
13627,"Ted, many a man--nay, many a soul--has their own tale of the sexless innkeeper. Why, I had run-in with one just last year. I even composed a poem about it. Would you care to hear it?",Barney
13628,Not really.,Ted
13629,"T'was the night before new year's, and the weather grew mean. It was 3:00 in the morning, And I was stranded in queens. (2008, the whole story of Barney is illustrated with images) The tavern grew empty, the gas lights grew dim. The horse-drawn carriages were all but snowed in...",Barney
13630,"Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?",Ted
13631,"Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, &quot;where do you live?&quot;And she said, &quot;one block south.&quot;. I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you",Barney
13632,"Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?",Ted
13633,"Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket",Barney
13634,No way.,Ted
13635,"I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you.",Barney
13636,"Which is funny, because usually it's the innkeeper who offers turndown service. Oh!",Robin
13637,"Hey, guys. Good news. First of all, you can ignore all the e-mails and texts we've sent you.",Lily
13638,We have. Go on.,Robin
13639,Because we went ahead and booked that couples' weekend for all of us inVermont!,Lily
13640,"Wait, you guys were serious about that?",Robin
13641,"Oh, we never joke about b&amp;b's, especially at the height of syrup season.",Marshall
13642,"Check it out. Saturday we've got apple-picking, antiquing, then a hated hay ride.",Lily
13643,"And then on Sunday, we're up at 6:00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike. Now, you better pack your long johns, 'cause it is cold up there.",Marshall
13644,"Look! I'm sorry that we have been dodging your calls, but we respect you guys too much as friends to give you some song and dance. You deserve the truth. (he sighs) The US Navy has found intelligent alien life at the bottom of the ocean. For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I have been tapped to lead the expedition.",Barney
13645,"Wow, Barney. That kind of sounds like the stuff you say to girls when you're too much of a coward to dump them.",Lily
13646,"Yeah. You know, that's exactly what it sounds like. But if that's true, that's awesome.",Marshall
13647,What's going on?,Lily
13648,"Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys.",Robin
13649,"Plus, the alien thing.",Barney
13650,"Come on,Marshall.",Lily
13651,Let's go.,Marshall
13652,No...Lily...,Robin
13653,You know what? I hope those underwater aliens are cold-blooded. 'cause then you guys will get along just fine.,Marshall
13654,I think they bought it.</p><h,Barney
13655,I can't believe they broke up with us.,Marshall
13656,We're so lovable.,Lily
13657,"No, we're not. We're ugly and gross.",Marshall
13658,I thought we did everything right.,Lily
13659,I know! I know. We had thegouda. We had my waffle story. I even sent them a awesome photo montage. Nothing.,Marshall
13660,"Oh, dear god.Marshall, we've been over and over this. You have to stop sending those to people.",Lily
13661,"Cat-sitting for Lily's mom, cat-sitting for Lily's mom, it's gonna be fun, it's gonna bring us all closer together. (in the video,Marshall let the cats going out by the window)",Marshall
13662,"Cat funeral, cat funeral, it was an accident and not entirely my fault, cat funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow, ca funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow. We'll miss you, whiskers, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow...",Marshall
13663,I can't believe you sent them one of those. They think we're insane now.,Lily
13664,"If I recall, they didn't dump us until you brought up thatVermont trip. It was way too early. First, a boat ride around the city, then a trip toVermont. It's a rookie mistake, and you're better than that.",Marshall
13665,"Oh, what about you forgetting to check the egg timer for charades? I gave you one thing to do,Marshall. One thing.",Lily
13666,"One thing? (Lily nods) One thing? Wow. Really? So, I guess that gouda Just walked itself right through the door...Sliced itself up, and arranged itself in a perfect semi-circle around not three, not four... But five different kinds of sturdy, cheese-bearing crackers?",Marshall
13667,"You're a sturdy, cheese-bearing cracker!</p><h",Lily
13668,"Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard.",Ted
13669,"Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day, But don't you have to get back up to the inn? I mean, who's working the front desk?",Barney
13670,"Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize.",Ted
13671,"To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving?",Barney
13672,"Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger.",Ted
13673,You're right.,Robin
13674,Thank you.,Ted
13675,All that sexlessness has made you wise.,Robin
13676,For god's sake!,Ted
13677,"Mint on the pillow, Ted! And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy! It does.",Barney
13678,Hey. We wanted to say we're sorry.,Robin
13679,Oh. I wish you had called.,Lily
13680,"(to a couple, inside the apartment) I swear, he was right there just eating a Belgian waffle!",Marshall
13681,Oh!,Marshall
13682,"Um, listen, now's not a good time. We'll call you.",Lily
13683,Wait. We just want...,Robin
13684,"Hey! Hey, guys.",Marshall
13685,Hey. Long time no see. Have a seat.,Barney
13686,"Oh, we can't. We're here with Py and Shea.",Lily
13687,"Yeah, sorry.",Marshall
13688,"Oh, it's just... We haven't seen you guys all week.",Robin
13689,"Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out.",Barney
13690,Yeah.,Robin
13691,"Oh, it might be weird. We're kind of on a double date. Wouldn't want you to feel like a fifth and sixth wheel.",Lily
13692,Who the hell are these people?,Barney
13693,They just moved here fromHawaii. Py is a total foodie,Lily
13694,Mmm!,Marshall
13695,"And Shea, well... She's...",Lily
13696,Shea...Shea is just...,Marshall
13697,"Anyhoo, we can't stay long. We're just gonna grab a quick beer and then take these kooks for a boat ride around the city.",Lily
13698,"Wow, it sounds like this is getting pretty serious.",Robin
13699,"Well, we don't want to jinx it, but, uh... We kind of think they might be the two. (he touches the table) Ooh.",Marshall
13700,"Pfft, who needs 'em?",Robin
13701,Pfft. Not us.,Barney
13702,Hi. Two for dinner.,Robin
13703,"Hey, why don't we call that weird couple down the hall from you? You know, with the ferrets? Maybe they want to come over and play taboo.",Barney
13704,"After midnight? No way. We can't tabooty-call them, it's pathetic.",Robin
13705,"Hey, guys.",Ted
13706,"Barney, are you wearing sweat pants?",Ted
13707,Maybe. But they're Armani.,Barney
13708,"Okay, guys, I've got some bad news for you. So I'm just going to come out and say it. You're a couple. And no matter how hard you try to fight it, couples need other couples. That's why you miss Marshall and Lily. And can't you just admit that?</p><h",Ted
13709,"Oh, yeah!",Marshall
13710,"I know! When I got that left-hand- yellow, I was like, &quot;what?!&quot;",Lily
13711,"Oh, right back at you!",Marshall
13712,For charades.,Robin
13713,How do we know you two won't hurt us again?,Lily
13714,You don't.,Robin
13715,You know what? We have two very nice people up in that apartment Who are perfect for us.,Marshall
13716,"Then what are you doing, standing out in the rain with us?",Barney
13717,Damn it. Why is there something so attractive about a bad boy... And girl?,Lily
13718,I think we can change them.,Marshall
13719,"Come here, you two.",Lily
13720,We'll never sleep on thegouda again.,Barney
13721,"Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you. You want to hear it?",Ted
13722,"No, not really.",Barney
13723,"'twas the night before, I had hours to k*ll. (the whole story is illustrated with images) I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill.",Ted
13724,With quill?,Barney
13725,"Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said &quot;classy,&quot; but her eyes whispered &quot;sin.&quot; She said, &quot;you're a teacher?&quot; I said, &quot;yes, indeed.&quot; &quot;I must have you,&quot; she moaned.&quot;I'm turned on by tweed.&quot; With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper.",Ted
13726,No way. You made that up.,Barney
13727,Whew!,Barney
13728,"God, I love being single.",Ted

13731,"Okay, let's do this!",Robin
13732,"Ted, this hydro bill is bigger than Louis Cyr's biceps. What, you leave the garburator on all night, eh?",Robin
13733,"The... mmm. Social experiment. <em>(Chanting)</em> U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A...",Barney
13734,"Okay, okay. You know what, what does that even prove, okay? You chant anything, people we join in. <em>(Chanting)</em> Canada, Canada, Canada, Cana... Okay, they won't chant anything.",Robin
13735,No!,Marshall
13736,What Gazzola's?,Robin
13737,"A filthy mecca of spectacular if undercooked pizza located at 316 Kinzie Street, Chicago, Illinois.",Ted
13738,"Back in college, Ted and I used to take these crazy road trips from Connecticut all the way to Chicago just for Gazzola's pizza.",Marshall
13739,"22 hours. No map. We'd just jump in the Fiero and drive. We were like Lewis and Clark, if Lewis and Clark peed in empty soda bottles and had a bong made out of a cantaloupe.",Ted
13740,"Man, those Gazzola trips, that's... that's when we really became bros.",Marshall
13741,Mm. We ate nothing but jerky.,Ted
13742,Drank nothing but Tantrum.,Marshall
13743,"Oh, man, we went through a whole case of Tantrum one trip.",Marshall
13744,I was color blind for two weeks after that.,Ted
13745,I think that's the reason that I pass out when I hear church bells.,Marshall
13746,"It's probably a good thing they're closing Gazzola's. Those trips were brutal, right? The long hours in the car, the motion sickness, the smell.",Ted
13747,So what time are we leaving for Gazzola's tomorrow?,Marshall
13748,"I was thinking 9:00, 9:30.",Ted
13749,"I am ready to hit the road. I got baby wipes. I got a variety of jerky. I got six cans of Tantrum. Well, four. One b*rned though the can, the other one I drank already. <em>(He tears a pillow)</em> Tantrum! I am so psyched! Marshall and I haven't done something, just the two of us, for so long. Ever since he got married, he's turned from an &quot;I&quot; to a &quot;We&quot;.",Ted
13750,What do you mean?,Barney
13751,Think about it.,Ted
13752,"Hey, haven't seen you all week. How you doing?",Ted
13753,Do you watch the Jets game?,Ted
13754,We most certainly did.,Marshall
13755,How'd things go at the doctor?,Ted
13756,We no longer have a hemorrhoid problem.,Marshall
13757,Hmm.,Barney
13758,You guys will not believe this. I've been talking to my lawyer all morning. You know that guy I have a slight disagreement with at the Hoser Hut? He's filing as*ault charges.,Robin
13759,Come on!,Robin
13760,"I broke his nose with a chair. And now, apparently, I may end up getting deported.",Robin
13761,"Oh, my God, that sucks! Yeah. I'm gonna go do push-ups in the kitchen. Tantrum!",Ted
13762,"Well, there's only one possible way to avoid getting deported. My lawyer said I could become an American citizen.",Robin
13763,Perfect. Problem solved. Welcome aboard.,Barney
13764,"Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am.",Robin
13765,"I know, and it's provided us with a lot of laughs. But, Robin, if you want to live here, work here and throw chairs at people here, you have to do this.",Barney
13766,"Well, there's a citizenship test tomorrow.",Robin
13767,A cit...,Barney
13768,I'll think about it.,Robin
13769,"No, no, you have to do it. I'll help you study. We're gonna stay up all night long. I'm gonna drill you, and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna do some cramming and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna bone up on...",Barney
13770,"Okay, Barney.",Robin
13771,Sorry. It's a rich area.,Barney
13772,It is.,Robin
13773,"But you know, it's not going to be easy, this test. It's not like the Canadian citizenship test.",Barney
13774,How do you know the Canadian test is easy?,Robin
13775,It's Canada. Question one: Do you want to be Canadian? Question two: really?,Barney
13776,"Yes, I do! I don't why they make phone books anymore. Everything's online, right?",Ted
13777,Tantrum!,Marshall
13778,Tantrum!,Ted
13779,"All right, let's hit the road.",Lily
13780,You invited Lily?,Ted
13781,We most certainly did!,Marshall
13782,"I don't know if you caught that, but he did the &quot;we&quot; thing.",Barney
13783,"Yeah, I heard him.",Ted
13784,Okay.,Barney
13785,Road trip! So you guys want to talk about bitches? I'm kidding. They're called women.,Lily
13786,"All right, next stop: Chicago.",Ted
13787,I have to pee.,Lily
13788,Couldn't you have gone before we left?,Ted
13789,I did. I just pee a lot. You'll see.,Lily
13790,"Don't worry, we'll get out on the road, it'll be just like old times.",Marshall
13791,"Sugar snap pea? Pea... That reminds me, I have to pee.",Lily
13792,"Okay, straight, straight, straight. Now, wait, a little to the left. We'll pass a state trooper.",Ted
13793,Ow!,Ted
13794,"Yellow, that reminds me, I have to pee.",Lily
13795,Thank you!,Ted
13796,"Great. Oh, hey, Ted...",Lily
13797,You can't have to go again. It's not humanly possible.,Ted
13798,"No, I was just going to say maybe we should listen to something.",Lily
13799,"Oh, that's a great idea. I think I have some Jerky Boys.",Ted
13800,"Goodbye, Sparky.",Marshall
13801,It's an audio book about a boy and his dog. It made Elisabeth Hasselbeck cry.,Lily
13802,Oh!,Marshall
13803,"That reminds me, I have to pee.",Lily
13804,&quot;How many stars are on the flag?&quot;,Barney
13805,"50, one for each state.",Robin
13806,&quot;What are the first ten amendments to the Constitution called?&quot;,Barney
13807,"The Bill of Rights. Look, Barney, I know all this. I'm ready.",Robin
13808,"Ready for the test maybe, but ready to be an American? Not on your sweet life. For you to be an American, we got to get the Canadian out of you. That's why I've created these questions. Question one: &quot;Who is this?&quot;",Barney
13809,Queen Elizabeth II.,Robin
13810,"No, the answer is Elton John. Question two: &quot;What the hell is this?&quot;",Barney
13811,"Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played...",Robin
13812,"Wrong. The answer we were looking for was &quot;I don't care, it's dumb&quot;. Let's go buy something that's bad for us and then sue the people who made it. That's America, Robin.",Barney
13813,"Oh, my God, Lily, please tell me you have to go pee!",Ted
13814,"Ah, I do.",Lily
13815,"Well, don't worry, the next exit's the hotel. We can go there.",Marshall
13816,Hotel?,Ted
13817,"Well, I mean, single people can have fun here, too, right?",Marshall
13818,I want to say- Jefferson?,Robin
13819,Correct.,Barney
13820,Oh!,Robin
13821,Archie Bunker's neighbor was George Jefferson.,Barney
13822,"Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now!",Robin
13823,"All right, hold your horses. Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie and the childhood obesity it leads to- who is this?",Barney
13824,"That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the &quot;Hey, Vern&quot; guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy.",Robin
13825,"Jeff Foxworthy? No, it's Jim Varney. You're kidding me. You don't know that?",Barney
13826,"Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face.",Robin
13827,"Not only are you wrong, but you are belligerently sticking to your g*n and insulting me in the process. Robin Scherbatsky- you are an American.",Barney
13828,"It didn't work, I'm still here. Marshall, what are we doing? We should be on the road.",Ted
13829,"Ok, Ted, we're not in college anymore, okay? We don't have to drive all night.",Marshall
13830,"Besides, they have a spa. What kind of treatments do you offer?",Lily
13831,Whoa. I got to dial back on the Tantrum.,Ted
13832,"Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all. <em>(She throws one bottle on the floor)</em> Maybe I'll rob a liquor store. Maybe I won't. My choice. Learn English! The Hoser Hut. I could duck in for a drink. No, no, that life's behind me. Forget it. Well, I could in for just one beer. What's the harm in that? It's a free country. <em>(She crosses the road and enter into the bar)</em> *O Canada Our home and native land...* Oh, God, I miss it. *True patriots love...*",Robin
13833,"Hey, man.",Ted
13834,Shh.,Marshall
13835,Sorry about what I said before. You want to go to the store and get some beer?,Ted
13836,Lily is asleep. I suppose I could reschedule my pedicure. What the hell? But only light beer because we have a couple hike in the morning.,Marshall
13837,"Dude, why are we pulling to the highway? Ted, where exactly are we going to get this beer?",Marshall
13838,Chicago.,Ted
13839,"What are you doing? We can't just leave Lily. When she wakes up, she's going to freak!",Marshall
13840,She'll have a back rub and a crumpet. She'll be fine. Relax. Have some fun.,Ted
13841,I just abandoned my wife. How am I supposed to have fun?,Marshall
13842,"Hey, you really think Lily's pissed?",Ted
13843,"If she's pissed, she's pissed.",Marshall
13844,Pfft.,Ted
13845,Good morning.,Barney
13846,"Barney? Oh, my God. What happened last night?",Robin
13847,You went Canadian.,Barney
13848,How Canadian?,Robin
13849,This Canadian. <em>(He opens the curtains)</em> Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky- you're in Toronto.,Barney
13850,"Oh, God. Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut... And I met this women's curling team.",Robin
13851,"We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams/Rich title double bill in Toronto.",Robin
13852,"How did you find me, anyway?",Robin
13853,"You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic...",Barney
13854,Canada isn't across the Atlantic.,Robin
13855,"You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours.",Barney
13856,"Barney, I'm not taking the test.",Robin
13857,"God, you're still drunk.",Barney
13858,"Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be.",Robin
13859,"Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee, in you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test. But, before any of that, we're gonna do it on this bed 'cause... hotel room. Okay, let's get some coffee.",Barney
13860,Kind of cross.,Ted
13861,You're making me wonder if this pizza is worth the 22 hour drive.,Marshall
13862,Just like old times!,Ted
13863,I feel so young again except for the chest pains.,Marshall
13864,But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust?,Ted
13865,Cornmeal...,Marshall
13866,We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!,Lily
13867,I can't believe you guys are closing.,Ted
13868,It's like an entire country without a tailor.,Barney
13869,"Yeah, give me two coffees.",Robin
13870,What game?,Robin
13871,"Oh, I guess I missed it.",Robin
13872,I'm not American.,Robin
13873,What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.,Barney
13874,"Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either.",Robin
13875,And there's kids playing hockey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you.,Barney
13876,I don't want this anymore.,Marshall
13877,"Dude, don't look at it. That's a rookie mistake.",Ted
13878,We shouldn't have left Lily.,Marshall
13879,"Well, if you're so worried, why don't you give her a call?",Ted
13880,"I have. I left her, like, 20 messages. I said, &quot;I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's all Ted's fault!&quot;",Marshall
13881,What exactly is &quot;Ted's fault&quot;?,Ted
13882,"This! This whole thing! We were having a perfectly nice trip, and then you kidnapped me. You didn't even let me, put on underwear!",Marshall
13883,"We never used to put on underwear! That was the fun of a bro's trip to Gazzola's! We left everything, and everyone behind. It was just you and me! But now it's like you've disappeared into Lily.",Ted
13884,That is not true.,Marshall
13885,"It is true. You're not upset because you're worried she's mad. You're upset because you'd rather be with her, eating muffins than here with me, eating this delicious... I think one of my mushrooms just crawled away.",Ted
13886,"Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's living. Car keys, please.",Marshall
13887,"Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back.",Barney
13888,"When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country.",Robin
13889,"Okay, that's it. <em>(He climbs on a chair)</em> Attention, Canada! I am Barney from America. And I'm here to fix your backward-ass country. Number one: get real money. Don't know what board game this came from, but it's a &quot;jhoke&quot;. Number two- and this is the biggie- Quit letting awesome chicks like Robin Scherbatsky get away because, guess what? You don't want her? I'm planting my flag in her- if you know what I mean, which you probably don't- and getting her the hell out of here. You may now return to being pointless. <em>(He sits down and three men arrive behind him)</em> Ah, this coffee is excellent. Oh. Hey, fellas. It's called a &quot;tie&quot;.",Barney
13890,"I'm sorry, ted!",Marshall
13891,"I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. I never should have been mad at you!",Ted
13892,"No, I never should have brought lily. She pees all the time, even at the apartment. Still bros?",Marshall
13893,"Best bros. Hey, you want to crank some Van Halen just like old times?",Ted
13894,"Hells, yeah!",Marshall
13895,Or listen to the Sparky book again?,Ted
13896,Listen to the Sparky book again.,Marshall
13897,Okay. Let's listen to it again.,Ted
13898,"Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday.",Barney
13899,"Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, &quot;Yeah, America's cool.&quot;",Robin
13900,Hmm.,Barney
13901,"And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, &quot;Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too.&quot; I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian.",Robin
13902,"Wait, you can do that?",Barney
13903,"Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two.",Robin
13904,I see.,Barney
13905,You understand?,Robin
13906,"No, I can see out of my left eye again.",Barney
13907,"Hey, baby? Baby?",Marshall
13908,Hmm? Yeah?,Lily
13909,I'm so sorry that we left you.,Marshall
13910,"Did you go somewhere, sweetie?",Lily
13911,"Mmm... Oh, oh, oh... Yeah...",Lily
13912,"So, I had a great time, too.",Lily
13913,That's good. And I'm so sorry you didn't get any pizza.,Marshall
13914,"Oh, that's okay.",Lily
13915,"God, my stomach! Damn you, Gazzola's!",Marshall
13916,It's like a hot ball of lead!,Ted
13917,"Baby, cut it out of me.",Marshall
13918,"That was a wild trip, huh, Ted?",Marshall
13919,I know. It was kind of crazy. But how great is it to drink some Tantrum again?,Ted
13920,"You know who had fun, was Lily. Lily drank like, four cans of the stuff. Right Lil'? Where's Lily?",Marshall
13921,This is nonsense. They are still playing the bagpipes.,Robin
13922,I know. It's been 6 hours. That must be the fact that Stan Tantric bagpipes.,Ted
13923,"It does not stop him from screaming to play louder, but it seems that there is rather strong. I have a glass of water in my room that vibrates like Jurassic Park.",Robin
13924,Are there neighbors! Stop the bagpipes!,Ted
13925,I hate to be the one to tell you. Marshall and Lily get divorced.,Barney
13926,Not at all.,Ted
13927,Look what I saw yesterday.,Barney
13928,"Baby, you can wash it?",Lily
13929,No problem.,Marshall
13930,I gotta go.,Barney
13931,"She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum.",Barney
13932,There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.,Ted
13933,They have a big problem.,Barney
13934,"I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... &quot;little known&quot; because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Robin, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever.",Ted
13935,"If, when you're great like me. Listen to this. Robin taking into account the number of beds in which we did. One is 83 and a half.",Barney
13936,And a half?,Ted
13937,An Ottoman 19th in an antique shop.,Barney
13938,What's new?,Marshall
13939,Big Tiger. You holding up? Want a hug? You mean yesterday? You're safe here.,Barney
13940,"According to Barney, Lily asking you to do your own dishes right away is a sign that your marriage falls apart.",Ted
13941,"Why? Lily loves a clean sink so I do the dishes right away, what's the problem?",Marshall
13942,I'll tell you what's the problem. You know how I was always the best single? Now I'm the best in relationship. Even better than you and Lily.,Barney
13943,"Look at you. You got a girlfriend for 5 minutes and you think playing in the big leagues. Adorable. Son... I'm in a relationship for your ponytail and that you were playing the guitar with Dave Matthews Mom. I am a good boyfriend when I sleep. I can do a k*ll foot massage, hand and prepare a great chamomile on the other, which would make you cry. Damn, I know more about how to make popcorn and watch movies with Sandra Bullock in that you'll ever know, but thank you to worry, blue.",Marshall
13944,Let me ask you a question.,Barney
13945,Go ahead.,Marshall
13946,"Do you mind you, if the sink is full of dirty dishes?",Barney
13947,Not really.,Marshall
13948,"So what is the problem of Lily, not yours.",Barney
13949,"But if I said that, we will play, so...",Marshall
13950,"You argue. Robin, we do not fight.",Barney
13951,Of course I do.,Ted
13952,"No. And here's the secret, every time we say we're going to argue...",Barney
13953,Why is there a bag of pants marked &quot;April 2008&quot; in your closet?,Robin
13954,So when you think you will play and you get up you go?,Ted
13955,It works in 100% of cases. No fighting if you're not there.This is what Gandhi said.,Barney
13956,This is not true.,Ted
13957,I can not believe Robin supports it.,Marshall
13958,Do not worry. It also has a good way to avoid arguments.,Barney
13959,The ties go to the machine?,Robin
13960,You're leaving. Robin begins to coat. I never heard anything so stupid.,Marshall
13961,"Well, the thing naked is not bad. It was weird.",Ted
13962,Call me crazy.,Marshall
13963,Mad.,Ted
13964,"But when you have a problem with Lily, it is discussed.",Marshall
13965,"There's so much to do with the mouth. Why spoil it by talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say on the dishes if I was married to Lily.",Barney
13966,"Barney, you came home!",Lily
13967,Go to the basics!,Marshall
13968,Okay.,Barney
13969,"Thank you, doll.",Barney
13970,"Honey, you're going to wash it?",Lily
13971,"I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, &quot;Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel&quot; is what you will paint the?",Barney
13972,No. Of course not.,Lily
13973,"Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing.",Barney
13974,Thank you explained that. I get confused easily.,Lily
13975,It's because you're a woman.,Barney
13976,I do not even know why we laugh!,Lily
13977,Of course not.,Barney
13978,Are you kidding me.,Ted
13979,"Wait, Ted. Listen to the man.",Marshall
13980,"Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy a*tillery.",Barney
13981,"Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes.",Barney
13982,You're right. I'll do the dishes. Just after doing this.,Lily
13983,"Now, turn around.",Barney
13984,You b*at him or I do it?,Ted
13985,He's right.,Marshall
13986,"No. Marshall, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Barney Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003.",Ted
13987,The piercing was cool.,Barney
13988,"It was cool, huh?",Marshall
13989,Stay with me! Barney is wrong.,Ted
13990,"No, not at all. I hate doing the dishes right away.",Marshall
13991,You just said the opposite!,Ted
13992,I hate it! I hate it from the depths of my soul! I hate it! I hate it I hate it!,Marshall
13993,You're welcome.,Barney
13994,Okay. There you are. You're gonna tell me the truth. Barney said that you did ever played.,Ted
13995,I think that's true.,Robin
13996,I told you.,Barney
13997,Impossible. I love you both but you're the two biggest emotional disabilities in the history of relations. You had to play at least once.,Ted
13998,"You know what? It's true. We tried to find out which of us was most great. But it said draw and we made love. Speaking of that, I am delighted that we go skiing this weekend. I need a break. The upstairs neighbors make me crazy.",Robin
13999,"Yeah, it's ugly. I'll go talk to them.",Ted
14000,Thank you.,Robin
14001,"Super. Here are your tasks for the weekend. Ted, you're gonna go see the neighbors. Marshall, you go see Lily. Robin and I need you for a crouched position on an animal skin in our chalet. Ready? Break!",Barney
14002,Have fun.,Ted
14003,"Barney... With his madness, his theory goes well thought might work.",Marshall
14004,I will repeat once. This is a bad idea.,Ted
14005,Will it work.,Marshall
14006,A second time. This is a bad idea.,Ted
14007,"Barney argued logically. Lily is a reasonable woman. I think if I explain, understand and can go in my opinion.",Marshall
14008,No. She will be angry and you will play.,Ted
14009,It is a slap bet?,Marshall
14010,We bet a slap.,Ted
14011,"Baby, you can do the dishes?",Lily
14012,"Lily, I am delighted that you mention.",Marshall
14013,I can stay here tonight?,Marshall
14014,"I am preparing the couch, man.",Ted
14015,The ski babes are back!,Robin
14016,How was the trip?,Ted
14017,Okay.,Barney
14018,"We spent the weekend hugging the fireside. No black diamonds, nothing but red hearts. I'll unpack my bags.",Robin
14019,What has happened between you? When did you become disgusting?,Ted
14020,"It's not great to finally see blossomed emotionally, spiritually and sexually?",Barney
14021,We all came out a year.,Ted
14022,"short, and your weekend?",Barney
14023,Terrible. And because of you! I listened to your advice stupid!,Marshall
14024,"Baby, you can do the dishes?",Lily
14025,"Lily, I am delighted that you mention. No. And that's why... It's like, okay? You want me to get up and I wash my dishes. But maybe... I want you... combs the ceiling, right? I can say, &quot;Yes. I will do my dishes, if you get up and you painted the ceiling of naked babies. &quot; You see? It's just...",Marshall
14026,"I do not know what happened. I am a lawyer. I earn my living by arguing but when it is with Lily, I'm... confused. How not to be with her eyes and her breasts?",Marshall
14027,What happened to the &quot;I'm tired after my exhausting day and I want to use what little energy I have left to cover you with love&quot;?,Barney
14028,I should have noted.,Marshall
14029,I'm making more money than you.,Marshall
14030,Excuse me?,Lily
14031,Dance for me.,Marshall
14032,"It's so much better when you said but with me, it turned into an argument. And when we started arguing, it starts to mutate and multiply.",Marshall
14033,It started with the dishes but after...,Marshall
14034,So you're saying you should not do the dishes because you work harder than me.,Lily
14035,"It's not what I say... but it's true. And suddenly, we argue as to who works the hardest.",Marshall
14036,I teach kindergarten. I shape the leaders of tomorrow.,Lily
14037,You eat cookies and you glue stuff. And other disputes are parties. Until there is so much we can no longer follow.,Marshall
14038,"If you need to go there at night, or you turn on the light or toilet you sit.",Lily
14039,My mother does not hate you. It is neutral about you.I'm not afraid of your imitation of Shining. I just did not need to hear it mostly at night.,Marshall
14040,"Danny is not here, Mrs. Torrance.",Lily
14041,"Do not do that, please.",Marshall
14042,"Dude, Lily is played badly. It is small... but as a vicious badger that your brother would have caught and starved for 5 days and placed in your sleeping bag. I should go and apologize.",Marshall
14043,"You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean. Why, it would relieve any anxiety to any meal. Not having to tie your T-shirt to form a bowl of salted fortune for your pleasures. This world belongs to you, Marshall.Beach house, take it, put yourself in holiday clothes, benefits.",Barney
14044,He's right.,Marshall
14045,Barney's stupid ideas you have put into this mess. There is no escaping it. Make this stupid dishwasher.,Ted
14046,This dish is my manhood! And I want to leave my manhood deep in the dirty sink full of ketchup and pasta...,Marshall
14047,What do you eat?,Barney
14048,"Well shit, it's my right! I will wipe my manhood when I'm ready!",Marshall
14049,"Where is he was not riding? Hey, Barnstormer.",Robin
14050,"Hey, Ro-Ro.",Barney
14051,You're cute nicknames? Seriously. What happens to you both?,Ted
14052,Nothing. We're just happy.,Robin
14053,"As Gandhi said, &quot;A smile costs nothing, baby.&quot;",Barney
14054,I'm not sure that you know who Gandhi is.,Ted
14055,So you talked to the neighbors?,Robin
14056,"Yeah, yeah, I did. I went up ready to put them back.",Ted
14057,Some old?,Robin
14058,Really old.,Ted
14059,So you did what?,Robin
14060,"I did not have the strength to tell them to stop, because, good for them. So I told them you want to welcome, ate a hard caramel, acquiesced to some r*cist comments and I left.",Ted
14061,"I do not care if the dishes are not done. If you do not give a damn, do it.",Marshall
14062,"Super. So I do not care if you have an orgasm. If you do not give a damn, do it yourself.",Lily
14063,I spent 18 years without a woman does not affect me. I can do it again.,Marshall
14064,You will perhaps have to do it again.,Lily
14065,"I do not know what to do. We never had to fight so long. It's as if I no longer existed. Sunday morning, she made a pancake, Ted. A pancake and a slice of bacon.",Marshall
14066,It's your fault. You took advice in love with Barney.,Ted
14067,"Well, maybe Barney was all inclusive. He and Ro-Ro are the best pair now. With Lily it was dethroned.",Marshall
14068,"You know, I do not believe all this stuff cute and adorable, it's not them. And I know for a fact that Robin hates nicknames.",Ted
14069,"Thank you, Robbie Engineering.",Ted
14070,I do not like nicknames.,Robin
14071,"You're finished with the sports page, Sherbs?",Ted
14072,"Seriously, stop.",Robin
14073,It's T-Mose.,Ted
14074,I do not like with you either.,Robin
14075,"Apparently, she loves them now. And... come on, someone had to stop T-Mose.",Marshall
14076,T-Mose was great. I think of the show.,Ted
14077,The bagpipe seems different today. There was an echo.,Marshall
14078,They're probably playing the bagpipes on the shower chair.,Ted
14079,How will Marshall and Lily?,Barney
14080,"Those two worry me, really.",Robin
14081,"You and your big, huge heart.",Barney
14082,Enough. The game is over.,Ted
14083,What do you mean by that?,Barney
14084,"Who, him?",Robin
14085,"It's going to come. You see, I knew it was wrong. You two were too happy, too radiant, too &quot;surnomants&quot;. It was not right.Never disputes? Crap. You argue all... the... time.",Ted
14086,How would you know that?,Robin
14087,Phil told me.,Ted
14088,Who the hell is Phil?,Barney
14089,Your downstairs neighbor.,Ted
14090,And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations?,Ted
14091,All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend.,Barney
14092,I found at Marshall's arguments Lily were zero then it will never have to wash another dish. Slap me in two.,Barney
14093,It's your board that is zero.,Robin
14094,You're on the side of Lily? You... (The chairlift stops) No. We will argue and I can not spin.,Barney
14095,I can not undress. It's freezing here. I'll be hypothermic.,Robin
14096,Or so I tried the jump?,Barney
14097,Or just the pants?,Robin
14098,This trick of dodging is over?,Barney
14099,I think.,Robin
14100,You have the? This is the smallest!,Barney
14101,They fight because of you!?,Robin
14102,And it does not stop there. We argue non-stop since.,Barney
14103,All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties.,Robin
14104,The tie m*rder by Robin.,Barney
14105,The hidden camera in the headboard.,Robin
14106,"As a quarterback to stay on top. Monday morning, he sits on an ice pack and are studying the tape of the match.",Barney
14107,Barney for the millionth time...,Robin
14108,I knew it! I knew you were too cute and perfect!,Ted
14109,"Look, we were fed up everyone to tell us how we are no relations.",Barney
14110,It was nice to be the ideal couple for one minute.,Robin
14111,I knew you were lying. Get up early for the feint-T Mose.,Ted
14112,Stop it.,Robin
14113,"Marshall, dinner is ready.",Lily
14114,You've done for me?,Marshall
14115,"No, but what is your favorite.",Lily
14116,We need advice.,Barney
14117,I'll do the dishes directly to my death.,Marshall
14118,"I do not care when you take out. But if it is made of cheese as a good ziti, do soak.",Lily
14119,"Sure, honey.",Marshall
14120,I love you.,Lily
14121,I love you too.,Marshall
14122,"You see? At the moment, how did you do to fix everything?",Robin
14123,I do not know. Sometimes you just let his ego aside.,Marshall
14124,And keep in mind that the love you have for that other person is more important than winning.,Lily
14125,More important than winning.,Barney
14126,"Calm. Calm down. Seriously, what's the secret?",Robin
14127,"The honeymoon phase may be over, but now you can get down to business. And honestly, it's the best part.",Lily
14128,Good night.,Robin
14129,What about now?,Barney
14130,I think we should talk about advantage and get down to business.,Robin
14131,"Or, there is a bench in the elevator.",Barney
14132,"That's better. It is not the best couple in the world, so what?",Robin
14133,Grave. It's not a competition.,Barney
14134,We won!,Lily
14135,Best couple of the world!,Marshall
14136,Guess what? These glasses are plastic. So you can throw them. So no dirty dishes in the sink.,Marshall
14137,You're dirty. It is you who should be in the sink.,Lily
14138,"Your girlfriend? This is your girlfriend!? It is small and it's your friend? Do not humanize the enemy. But, delighted.",Barney
14139,Come on. Open it. It's p*rn collection! Just kidding. It would be weird.,Barney
14140,It's your p*rn collection.,Ted
14141,"This is my collection of p*rn! I offer you my p*rn. Now that it goes really well with Robin, I need more.",Barney
14142,"Voluntarily, you abandon your p*rn...? You're really serious.",Lily
14143,This is obvious.,Marshall
14144,What does that mean?,Barney
14145,"Nothing, it's just, you know, you have love handles.",Marshall
14146,What?! I have no love handles. This is ridiculous.,Barney
14147,"It's nothing. Once you're with someone, it is natural to let some go. Trust me. It's been there.",Marshall
14148,He really is growing at a time.,Lily
14149,"We gotta go. Goodbye, my dear friends. You were always there for me. We will miss you.",Barney
14150,He speaks to p*rn.,Robin
14151,"Hi, Robin. A more.",Ted
14152,Hi.,Robin
14153,"My God, matte videos. The orgy of space? The surprise party of 23 students naughty?",Lily
14154,"You'd think after 22 celebrations, students would no longer surprises.",Marshall
14155,You can get rid of it.,Lily
14156,"No, it's not a problem. I'll do it.",Ted
14157,Are you sure? It's nothing. We can go around back and throw the box in the trash.,Lily
14158,I read six of the words you just said about this jacket.,Marshall
14159,"Seriously, this is nothing. I'm on it.",Ted
14160,Because...,Lily
14161,"Let them! In a sense, it's sad, right? Barney who abandons his p*rn. He has love handles. They eat the same thing every night. We are witnessing the end of Barney Stinson as we know it.",Ted
14162,So what? They are happy.,Marshall
14163,Let's go. A more.,Lily
14164,So you're what?,Marshall
14165,I Tail-Dalle.,Lily
14166,What...? I thought I had seen in one take.,Marshall
14167,Yeah. It's called Tail-Dalle.,Lily
14168,ArchiSexTure. That's not how you write &quot;Buckminster Fuller.&quot;,Ted
14169,I get rid of this horrible pornography on the field.,Ted
14170,"If you watch this tape, and I knew it... is that you are in possession of all my p*rn. It can only mean two things, either I'm dead or I'm in a committed relationship. If I died, I want you honor my memory by taking my body in the Hamptons and recreating Weekend at Bernie. I want to dance. I want to make love. And I want to go fishing. If, on the other hand, I'm in a relationship, as best friend, I have one favor to ask. Please, for God's sake, get me out of here!",Barney
14171,"I can look happy, but do not believe it. Barney Stinson is suited for celibacy. (Marshall and Lily have joined Ted) Out of pity, if our best friends account... And yes, Marshall, I'm his best friend, how you take it? So, get me out of here. And finally, since you hoping to see some p*rn... (Barney turns the camera towards the bed where a woman waits) Do not worry. The green light means it is off.",Barney
14172,We're sure he had done?,Lily
14173,"There is no reason to take it seriously, though?",Ted
14174,"No, of course. This is an old tape. Barney is pleased with Robin.",Lily
14175,So what you did last night?,Lily
14176,"I wanted to go to a concert. Him at a party. We could obviously do what the other wanted, so we stayed to watch a movie on cable.",Robin
14177,It was Legen... wait... the Autumn. Legends of the Fall!It was fun.,Barney
14178,"I spotted this girl there, and I will need help to land the plane.",Ted
14179,"Sorry, I have my own way tonight.",Barney
14180,How do you go?,Lily
14181,Super. Relations are deadly...,Barney
14182,Shut up...,Robin
14183,Exchanges and compromise...,Barney
14184,Shut up...,Robin
14185,Monogamy is the best.,Barney
14186,Shut up.,Robin
14187,Tagline!,Barney
14188,Shut up.,Robin
14189,More hungry...,Barney
14190,I can... in a minute.,Barney
14191,They k*ll.,Ted
14192,They love each other.,Lily
14193,"Barney and Robin are in love, but they are more Barney and Robin. They are big and old.",Ted
14194,My favorite cop show.,Marshall
14195,This is obvious. Barney eats too much because he hates to lose his freedom. Robin and stress because she hates what has become Barney.,Ted
14196,They are perfect together.,Lily
14197,It might be the problem. They are too similar. It's hard to have two dominant in a relationship.,Ted
14198,We are two dominant sets.,Marshall
14199,"Of course, my heart.",Lily
14200,"If they are not happy, why not break?",Marshall
14201,They are too stubborn. Neither wants to be the first to admit he no longer wants. They play at first that deflates.,Ted
14202,I think the first who plays Barney deflates.,Marshall
14203,It's a bad time. It takes time to get used to each other. They are... How do you say &quot;selfish&quot; nicely?,Lily
14204,Independents. Every relationship goes through there.,Lily
14205,"It's true... I had a friend astronaut, totally in love with his fiancee. On the eve of her mission, she surprised him with four other girls and two guys. It has become intense. She ended up sneaking into the space shuttle...",Marshall
14206,Talk about Space Orgy?,Ted
14207,Yeah.,Marshall
14208,It's a bad time. Let us do things.,Lily
14209,She's right.,Marshall
14210,"Two against one, Ted. Let them.",Lily
14211,"Did you notice that the beef ribs were absolutely disgusting, but recently they have become delicious?",Barney
14212,"I'll get to the point, and ask you a question. Are you happy with Robin?",Marshall
14213,Are you kidding?! How could I not be? It's Robin!,Barney
14214,So you're happy?,Marshall
14215,"Can you ask me this question. We argue constantly, but you know what they say about relationships, &quot;Every moment is a battle.&quot;",Barney
14216,So you're happy?,Marshall
14217,And you know what happens right after a fight? Gender reconciliation. What is different... when you're in a loving and lasting relationship.,Barney
14218,"Stack we make love, we order a pizza face and it stays there to moan.",Barney
14219,Okay. Decides that the piece.,Robin
14220,What was the pizza again?,Barney
14221,Face.,Robin
14222,It's face.,Barney
14223,"Sex... I'm right? Fortunately, it is becoming rare. I'm still hungry. You're hungry?",Barney
14224,We must break them. You're right. Barney and Robin are unhappy together but they are too stubborn to admit it. We must make the break.,Marshall
14225,What next?,Ted
14226,We will release... the Kraken.,Marshall
14227,Forget. I took my retirement. I no longer.,Lily
14228,But you're the best.,Marshall
14229,"I swear, I gave up these shots there. I became legit. I am now matchmaker.",Lily
14230,Find me someone.,Ted
14231,I just started.,Lily
14232,Please. You've got to break. This relationship is k*ll them.,Marshall
14233,"I know, but I learned the lesson. I no longer interferes. I let things.",Lily
14234,It's two against one.,Ted
14235,But the one that's me.,Lily
14236,No need for it. We can do it alone.,Ted
14237,How?,Marshall
14238,"When I was with Robin, you remember the only thing that made pinball?",Ted
14239,You do not have the right to do this to me.,Robin
14240,What are you talking?,Ted
14241,From this! That's what I mean. How does it feel in my champagne?,Robin
14242,"If Robin thinks for one second that Barney wants to marry her, she Petera a lead and they will break.",Ted
14243,"That sucks. Why not let Barney be tempted by a sexy girl? (Barney wipes his hands on his shirt) Okay, going to the ring.",Marshall
14244,A surveillance van.,Marshall
14245,What?,Ted
14246,"It should take one. We have ordered pizza, watched through binoculars and said, &quot;That's not why I signed,&quot; or stuff like that.",Marshall
14247,The server arrives.,Ted
14248,"Please, shut up.",Robin
14249,What?,Barney
14250,"I thought you had mentioned, sorry. (The waiter brings them two glasses of champagne) This is an engagement ring?Are you...?",Robin
14251,"No, this is not one. They had the wrong table. You can imagine we are married?",Barney
14252,We're committed to one another.,Robin
14253,Your business is already in my apartment.,Barney
14254,Easier for taxes.,Robin
14255,And for your naturalization.,Barney
14256,&quot;Scherbatsky&quot; is hard to spell.,Robin
14257,My mother would be so happy.,Barney

14266,What next?,Marshall
14267,"They are up to their necks. A single argument will not suffice. We must revive the four largest arguments they've ever had, at one time. Number one, the battle of dirty dishes. Number two, the conflict of ex-girlfriends.",Lily
14268,You do not know any that girl over there?,Robin
14269,"No, I do not think. (The woman bends down to pick something she brought down) No, actually, I do not know... This is Meg. I do not compare in my mind there. Can you pick me?",Barney
14270,Really?,Robin
14271,"Number three, the altercation Star Wars.",Lily
14272,You're not a bit old for that stupid doll?,Robin

14274,He wears a diaper.,Robin
14275,"No, it's protective armor.",Barney
14276,A stormtrooper? Rather a storm-merdeur.,Robin
14277,Come on.,Barney
14278,It looks like your storm-merdeur the changes we need.,Robin
14279,"You know, I'm sick.",Barney
14280,I said nothing.,Robin
14281,"The jokes about magic, the stormtrooper...",Barney
14282,"And, of course, the biggest, the Canadian-American w*r.",Lily
14283,"thank you God, the song is over. Who was the old devil who sang?",Barney
14284,You know Neil Young is my favorite musician.,Robin
14285,"She was the wife of Archie in All in the family, or the same voice?",Barney

14290,Alan Thicke?,Ted
14291,Oh yes. Robin was known when she sang.,Marshall
14292,"They are always in contact. I had his number on the mobile Robin. Seriously... amateurs. (She plunges into the scene) So, Alan Thicke stimulus battle USA / Canada. Just then, Meg-the-crazy happens. Then, a stormtrooper happening in the street.And just when they are tired, a diver passes with a basin full of what? Dirty dishes.",Lily
14293,This is your masterpiece.,Ted
14294,It takes a surveillance van!,Marshall
14295,A Break? Really? You have rented a station wagon?,Marshall
14296,A van costs $ 25 more.,Ted
14297,A Break?,Marshall
14298,Get in the car.,Lily
14299,What is that thing?,Ted
14300,They did not stormtrooper so I had to take another robot. It will work also.,Lily
14301,Another robot? The stormtroopers are not robots.,Ted
14302,Of course they are robots! &quot;Must k*ll Luke Skywalker&quot;,Lily
14303,No one said this in Star Wars.,Ted
14304,Very bad robot voice.,Marshall
14305,A film of Barney begins like that.,Ted
14306,Barney Five... order something.,Marshall
14307,Now you mention the movie.,Ted
14308,It continues. The server supports a second sheet.,Marshall
14309,We need it here. It is in hiding.,Lily
14310,A van is more expensive.,Ted
14311,Thank you!,Marshall
14312,"If you work the costume, they will pay us.",Ted
14313,Stop and think only of money.,Marshall
14314,Give a hand to the stormtrooper.,Lily
14315,Thank you!,Marshall
14316,$ 25!,Ted
14317,"No, go up. Wait... When they blew the Death Star with thousands of stormtroopers it was human?",Lily
14318,It was the Death Star. They did not sign in the wind.,Marshall
14319,You were in this video? The guy with the tan of a farmer?,Ted
14320,"You know what? Everyone, stop! Alan thicke, close it!Marshall is a break. Put-in-t. Ted, stop talking about p*rn. And for God's sake, give the pizza stormtrooper!",Lily
14321,Damn! They see us.,Lily
14322,You're sure they've seen us?,Marshall
14323,"Forget it is located. If you try something, they'll know it's us. We should all go...",Marshall
14324,This is my masterpiece. And then they saw us? It will work anyway.,Lily
14325,Come on. We find something else.,Ted
14326,"Alan Thicke, to you. Go ahead.",Lily
14327,They kiss? They should not! Why it does not work?,Lily
14328,Because they love.,Ted
14329,It was a bad spot.,Marshall
14330,What am I doing? All this was a mistake.,Lily
14331,"I thought that I would not say that this coir, but... Robin and Barney, the happy couple.",Ted
14332,Where is Barney?,Lily
14333,It was broken.,Robin
14334,Look at us. It is horrible all the time like that?,Robin
14335,"I'm not happy. Finally, I would be. Nothing would make me happier than to be happy, but... I'm not.",Barney
14336,"What are we doing wrong? We love. If it does not work, what then? We are so similar.",Robin
14337,We love scotch. It is awesome.,Barney
14338,That might be it. There may be too great there.,Robin
14339,"Exactly. Two awesome cancel out, and... I'm tired of being canceled.",Barney
14340,Me too. We separate?,Robin
14341,I think. Shit. Following happens. After which you and I can not become friends again.,Barney
14342,It's maybe not a break. This is perhaps... two friends... who find themselves.,Robin
14343,It's a stormtrooper?,Robin
14344,It's not a stormtr... We're going from here?,Barney
14345,"In addition, Alan.",Robin
14346,Friends that are found. I like it.,Barney
14347,One for the Road?,Robin
14348,"And then who knows? Maybe in 40 years, if you have not found anyone...",Barney
14349,I am already involved with Ted.,Robin
14350,"It's true. Thin. Maybe in 39 years, if you have not found anyone...",Barney
14351,"So, how is Barney?",Marshall
14352,"Well, I think. It may take a while to recover, but... You had a thrill?",Robin
14353,Dad returned.,Barney
14354,It is getting it soon.,Robin
14355,I love that you are always so many friends after this clip.,Lily
14356,What do you mean &quot;too&quot;?,Barney
14357,You then.,Robin
14358,You see that guy over there in diving suit? You think you're going to go talk to him?,Lily

14367,"You're not rush a little, then?",Lily
14368,"Since I went out with Robin there is a trick that I have not used as much as I wanted. It is... rather large, surprisingly heavy, with the skin, and it's black. My friends, this is the book of... Roles.",Barney
14369,"The Roles book contains all the scams, trickery, deception, underhand, cunning, nonsense, and embobinages tricks I used, or expected use, to nab the girls and do their business.",Barney
14370,You're writing another book? Stephen King was one right there.,Marshall
14371,"It's all there. Everything, starting from the basic, like Le Bois Do Not Ca...",Barney
14372,Do not drink it. I saw a guy put something.,Barney
14373,This guy.,Barney
14374,"... Until more advanced maneuvers, such as the Ms. Stinsfire.",Barney
14375,I do not see how it could not walk.,Marshall
14376,What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?,Ted
14377,"Glad you asked. The Lorenzon Von Matterhorn will be my comeback on stage. Or, you know, in my bed. In fact, my bed is on a stage. I put it on a platform and installed lighting. A real production. Barney goes!",Barney
14378,And you Robin? You leave it in play? Where is your book of Roles?,Marshall
14379,"My book? Buddy... in two volumes, right here.",Robin
14380,A great book.,Ted
14381,"Yeah, I'm reading it.",Lily
14382,"So, I have told you, I take a break on that side.",Robin
14383,It's going to happen.,Ted
14384,Bluntly.,Marshall
14385,What?,Robin
14386,You'll fall in love.,Ted

14391,It's good but...,Robin
14392,"Travis Frenchroy, replacing bartender told me... &quot;I'm done with all these rencards. I want to concentrate on my fan fiction of Star Trek. &quot;Six months later... Married!",Ted
14393,I answer? It's good for them...,Robin
14394,"Matthew Blitz, accounting job, said... &quot;I will die alone.To focus as much on taxes this year. &quot;Six months later? PACS and plans to marry pending the enactment of the Act currently in the Senate from New York!",Marshall
14395,"It happens, whatever you say. It is a law of nature.",Ted
14396,Judged. By nature.,Marshall
14397,Trust me. I would not get interested in relationships. I would not be single if I wanted to be single.,Ted
14398,Okay. Are you ready?,Lily
14399,Ready for what?,Ted
14400,"Three years ago, Shelly started working at my school.When I saw her, I said, &quot;It's perfect for Ted.&quot;",Lily
14401,Why do not you talk to me now?,Ted
14402,He is. It is so great and attentive and intelligent.,Lily
14403,Another chicken and stick to you the crown!,Marshall
14404,"I do not see it. It must be voluntary. So, another bar?",Lily
14405,Yeah she was pretty.,Ted
14406,It still is. And you're ready.,Lily
14407,But you can put three times more than chicken fingers in your mouth. You know.,Marshall
14408,I will fix it but promise me not to do anything stupid.,Lily
14409,I promise to do anything stupid.,Ted
14410,You should!,Lily
14411,You should! You should!,Lily
14412,And you met him at McLaren's?,Lily
14413,What is the name there?,Lily
14414,You... dirty bastard.,Lily
14415,Bluntly.,Lily
14416,I had put aside for Ted Shelly for 3 years.,Lily
14417,"My hen, Ted did not miss much. She is brainy, boring, a bit boring in bed. In fact it would have been perfect for Ted.Oops! (Lily hits him) If I had known she was there for Ted, I would have obviously not done, but... given the circumstances, I think Ted would be proud of me. I managed The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.",Barney
14418,"Exactly, yes.",Lily
14419,What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?,Lily
14420,Glad you asked.,Barney
14421,"To achieve the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn is what you need, basic knowledge in web design and a truly unique fake name. So think about your fake name right away. You? Fine.Now choose your target. (It is now at the bar) Preferably a girl with a great big... phone. (He approaches the counter Shelly installed) Yeah that's me.",Barney
14422,I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.,Barney
14423,"Yes. You do not know who I am, does not it? It feels good for once. Nice to meet you...",Barney
14424,"Shelly? Again, I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. It is written as it is pronounced, with two &quot;T&quot;. (He leaves) Then, once you leave, she takes out her phone and tries Lorenzo Von Matterhorn on the Internet. And that's when she discovers... A series of fake websites, all devoted to the incredible life of Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. A false item of business on Lorenzo, the hermit billionaire. The fake of the Explorer Club newsletter on his trip to the North Pole in an airship, a feat of imagination and challenge. The fake medical journal with a story to make you cry the doctors saying that a reduction of the penis is not an option. And time to return... (Barney returns to Shelly) I hate to be cheeky, but I can offer you a coffee?",Barney
14425,"How much is a coffee today, $ 50? And here we go.",Barney
14426,It's horrible. You realize you've broken her heart? She is inconsolable.,Lily
14427,Why would it be inconsolable? The airship of Lorenzo will not disappear in the Arctic for a week. Sorry if this is that someone told her that it was lies.,Barney
14428,It was all lies.,Lily
14429,Lies!,Lily
14430,Lies!,Lily
14431,"Men... Actually, that's true. I went there.",Lily
14432,Lies!,Lily
14433,"Oh my God! Well, I hope you are pleased with you.",Barney
14434,What?,Lily
14435,Thou hast broken my heart.,Barney
14436,Me?,Lily
14437,"You! She will never trust a man. You've spoiled for Ted.Not to mention Julio Von Matterhorn, the twin brother of Lorenzo.",Barney
14438,"Do you believe? He says it's my fault. And by the way, Ted, I bet she go out with you again.",Lily
14439,I'm thinking. Do I want to date a girl that Barney was typed?Help me for harmonies. Of course.,Ted
14440,That must bother you a bit.,Lily
14441,It's his life. These girls had it coming if they are stupid enough to be fooled.,Robin
14442,I agree. You've seen one called The Sn&amp;aring;sa?,Marshall
14443,"Actually, I'm in a top secret government space program called Secret NASA... Sn&amp;aring;sa.",Barney
14444,"No Moon you know, but I went on Slune.",Barney
14445,"If you fall in there, you break my heart, but sorry, you're sdÃ©bile.",Robin
14446,"Well, Barney, you go out... You just get out of a sincere relationship. You're a big boy now. You can return to your towers to two euros.",Lily
14447,Tours to two euros?! None of these towers is. The Tower A except two Euros.,Barney
14448,"I am the bassist for Tower Two Euros. And even that involves expensive hair extensions. Now, if you allow, I have to prepare for the event tonight. The I exÃ©cuterais he will not come.Glad you asked.",Barney
14449,"The To run it will not come, you will need the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Got it? Fine. For generations, this is the place chosen by New Yorkers for reunion with their lost lovers of view, you need to go to every girl and say, &quot;He will not come.&quot;",Barney
14450,Let it go. (He goes to another woman) He will not come.(Then another) He will not come. She's not coming? Sorry. (The woman leaves) Until... He will not come.,Barney
14451,I'll fetch the newspaper.,Robin
14452,"Or rather, look for a husband.",Ted
14453,Grave.,Marshall
14454,"You must stop, seriously. The last thing I'm looking for now is a relationship.",Robin
14455,"Taking the newspaper, think to watch the ads for marriages.For yours.",Ted
14456,It's like that. Have you any idea how many times in my life when I went to look for frozen waffles frozen in vain?,Marshall
14457,Thousands?,Robin
14458,"Millions. But when I go in search of a mirror or the remote because Lily and I had an argument and she has hidden there, whereupon I fall? Frozen waffles. It's like that. You go out to get the newspaper, but you come back with frozen waffles.And there, frozen waffles he's a guy. As long as you're there, you take it back frozen waffles? And there, frozen waffles are... frozen waffles.",Marshall
14459,What happened?,Robin
14460,"I tried the he will not come, and it worked. Monstrous.You should have seen this girl.",Barney
14461,I'm leaving.,Robin
14462,"So, we came up to me, and I go to my room to prepare the camera... lighting candles... and when I go out, nobody, paper and more roles! We all know who is responsible for that.",Barney
14463,"Yes, we know.",Lily
14464,Al-Qaeda.,Barney
14465,"No, you idiot. That was me.",Lily
14466,You... enfoirÃ©e dirty!,Barney
14467,An actress friend.,Lily
14468,An actress. Of course. That explains his perfect diction and style of Drag.,Barney
14469,I'm almost to the point of taking this book and put it on the net for everyone to see.,Lily
14470,You would not dare.,Barney
14471,"No, as you stop scams and confidence tricks, deception, underhand, tricks, schemes and embobinages.",Lily
14472,You did not say nonsense.,Barney
14473,No more nonsense!,Lily
14474,Slim.,Barney
14475,Sorry to interrupt but check it out.,Robin
14476,No.,Ted
14477,I was abandoned at the altar.,Barney
14478,"Oh, my god, it's horrible. I wonder if it works.",Ted
14479,And yet this is not the worst. Do you saw My Penis grants wishes?,Marshall
14480,Only if you rub hard enough.,Barney
14481,He starts singing and objects come alive and dance with him.,Ted
14482,It's not very well designed. This is not Ms. Stinsfire.,Marshall
14483,A few hours later...,Lily
14484,"Apparently, it will rain.",Ted
14485,"If you wonder, I would be at McLaren's playing a character from the Book of roles being called The Diver. That's all.",Barney
14486,"It's good. I put the Book of Roles on the Internet. Baby, you can put the Book of Roles on the Internet?",Lily
14487,"Sure baby, but there is something odd. I flipped through the whole book. There is no role called The Diver.",Marshall
14488,"Now you want to know what the diver. In fact, it was on the last page of the Book, but I pulled in case. But do not worry.You will see it in action. You see the blonde next to the bar?Cizzible repÃ©rizzÃ©e.",Barney
14489,"Barney, no. You are...",Lily
14490,"Forget it, kid. If anyone should be angry with me, this is Robin. She loves the book.",Barney
14491,I did not worship the book.,Robin
14492,"But what...? The Book of the Rolls, this is gold. Granted this is truly spectacular.",Barney
14493,"We just broke. The costumes are nice, but... it just broke.",Robin
14494,"I did not know you felt it. I was so caught up with my own projects as... Damn, she looks out there. Quickly dispersed.",Barney
14495,It's good. You see that guy over there in diving suit?,Lily
14496,And here we are.,Lily
14497,"I have no idea. And it's k*ll us, Claire. It k*ll us!",Marshall
14498,"So what does the diver? Claire and here, in passing.",Lily
14499,"Hello, Claire. I am Lieutenant Frank Lyman. I train dolphins b*mb detectors for... You know what? I can not do that.Robin, I'm sorry. I think this break is harder for me than expected.The Book of roles was just a way to change my mind.",Barney
14500,It's okay. It's hard for me too. Look at me. I gave up on relationships.,Robin
14501,She is getting married.,Marshall
14502,I will prepare my toast.,Ted
14503,I have to check my tuxedo.,Marshall
14504,I'll knock your heads like two coconuts.,Robin
14505,"I'm delighted that you stop it. And frankly, the real Barney is better than all the false Barney's Book of Roles.",Lily
14506,"Is it true? Claire, you must have heard a lot about the real Barney tonight. Want some coffee?",Barney
14507,"Before refusing, you should know that in this neoprene combined with what appears to be a pair of socks...",Lily
14508,"A Pringles, but still.",Barney
14509,... is an incredible kind. He's funny and it's one of my best friends. And he came out with this g*n.,Lily
14510,It's a good guy.,Robin
14511,"Come on, go out with him.",Ted
14512,"It's a coffee, huh?",Marshall
14513,It's nothing.,Robin
14514,I'm proud of him. It takes a lot of Pringles to be as vulnerable.,Marshall
14515,I had a message from Barney. &quot;Look under the table.&quot; (She looks under the table and finds an envelope) A page from the Book of Roles.,Lily
14516,It says what?,Robin
14517,It's The Diver.,Ted
14518,"Step one, talk to a friend Book Roles. Step two, play with one of his colleagues and make angry she steals the Book.Step three, put the combi and say you will do a final round, The Diver with the sexy girl next to the bar. Your friend, let's call her Lily, told him everything about the book. Now the hard part.When Lily and daughter are questioning The Diver, remove the mask, and pull out the stops on your deepest insecurities that do not exist because you are awesome. Sad for you, Lily talks about you to the girl who agrees to have coffee. And... is... gone.",Barney
14519,You dirty bastard...!,Lily
14520,"It is. You say you do not want a relationship. Well, the love of your life will not pass this door, and this is... this kind.",Marshall
14521,I will not fall in love with him.,Robin
14522,"Yes, because it is... this kind.",Ted
14523,"No comment. The blue jacket, it does not suit me, so...",Robin
14524,"Right, because here it is. It is this type! (A woman enters) Let him at least a chance. Get out a bit with it, see if it can give something.",Marshall
14525,I will work.,Robin
14526,"Yeah, right.",Marshall
14527,I'm really going to work.,Robin
14528,Yes.,Robin
14529,"Damn, Marshall.",Robin
14530,"It's beautiful. She is 10 pounds. It is organic. Do you remember my uncle Heinrek bald? Looks like his head squarely.(The taxi hand) Oh, my God! My my turkey... turkey!",Marshall
14531,We brought the turkey.,Robin
14532,You have brought back an old turkey replacement.Why I have not listened to the message of former mayor Ed Koch saying not to forget my business.,Marshall
14533,"With Robin we went to the objects found in the prefecture and there, sitting in their fridge... Is this your turkey?",Ted
14534,"Yes! It's my turkey! Come here, my beautiful little enfoirÃ©e!",Marshall
14535,I'll go put it in the oven.,Lily
14536,You're the best friends in the world!,Marshall
14537,It was a team effort.,Barney
14538,"I do not know what to say. It's Thanksgiving, but &quot;thank you&quot; does not seem enough.",Marshall
14539,You have done the same for us.,Ted
14540,"Yes, and you know why? Because I love you. And I'll show you how. Ted Mosby and Robin Scherbatsky, I bring you... the fourth slap.",Marshall
14541,Wait. What?,Barney
14542,You're saying...,Ted
14543,What you think you say?,Robin
14544,"Certainly not. Unless you were thinking... &quot;Baffegiving two: Revenge of the lower&quot; in this case, yes, that's what I'm saying!",Marshall
14545,The slaps are not transferable.,Barney
14546,Lily is the curator of the bet.,Marshall
14547,The slaps are transferable.,Lily
14548,You realize that you will remain one. Are you sure you want to spend a day.,Robin
14549,"Life is short. I tell myself, Baffe Diem. A rule, the slap must be given before sunset to avoid interference dinner Lily.",Marshall
14550,And how!,Lily
14551,"Two, you must decide which of you will. Three, we will attach to the chair Barney, now be called The Throne of Baffe. It fits you?",Marshall
14552,Awesome.,Lily
14553,Absolutely not!,Barney
14554,We expect someone else?,Lily
14555,Dad?,Lily
14556,"Rita, you are anxious... to move to Florida?",Marshall
14557,What has happened with your apartment?,Lily
14558,What has happened?,Lily
14559,You should pay rent to live in the basement of your parents.,Lily
14560,They surprised you with a girl?,Marshall
14561,Working? You are retired.,Lily
14562,You not only prevented them from moving to Florida but you obliged to rework grandfather?,Lily
14563,What is he doing here?,Lily
14564,I do not know but we should bring him in and discover.,Marshall
14565,I want to see him! Returns it!,Lily
14566,"Stay there, okay? We will solve the problem.",Marshall
14567,I hope Lily is well.,Robin
14568,"Me too. She speaks little, but that thing with his father gave him much trouble.",Ted
14569,Tell me which of you is going to slap me!,Barney
14570,What?,Ted
14571,"I die, I, here. Ted takes a chip, I jump! Robin arranges her hair, I jump! I jump all the time. It's bad for my skin. It gives me wrinkles. Wrinkles!",Barney
14572,"Lily, go. It's been 3 years. This is long enough.",Marshall
14573,The equity in my life brings me nothing but stress. It's easier that he is dead to me.,Lily
14574,"I've supported when our neighbor, Mr. Sias, died in your sight.",Marshall
14575,This is our journal.,Lily
14576,"And when Whitney, your maid of honor, had died in your sight.",Marshall
14577,You're worth it!,Robin
14578,"Thank you, girls.",Lily
14579,I even understood when Mr. Park to the grocery store downstairs was dead in your eyes.,Marshall
14580,"A coffee, please. But only if it is decaf. I want to sleep tonight.",Lily
14581,I'm sorry. Are you sure mine is decaf? You used the same coffee.,Lily
14582,"OK (She leaves the grocery store, coffee in hand. In his bed while sleeping Marshall)... You dirty bastard! (It returns in pajamas to the grocery store) It was not decaf!",Lily
14583,"I've supported with these unknowns, but it's your father, okay? We can at least give him some turkey?",Marshall
14584,No.,Lily
14585,"Go. Please, I can not ask him to leave at Thanksgiving.",Marshall
14586,"You did not ask. Tell him it's just important that it is here. In less than two, it will be a games convention in Toledo, to give money to your dental apparatus in a so-called Milton Bradley.",Lily
14587,He was trying to earn money to feed his family.,Marshall
14588,"No, that's what mom was doing with his two jobs. This man broke my heart every day for 20 years.",Lily
14589,So we can give pieces of chicken not cooked.,Marshall
14590,"Seriously Robin, you should have the slap. You're a big baffeuse. In fact, I want to study the slaps in your tutoring. I wanna be your apprentice-slap.",Ted
14591,Do not underestimate. You're a rock star of slaps. Your name should be Eric Baffe-PTON.,Robin
14592,This is torture. Put me in the chair...,Barney
14593,The Throne of Baffe.,Ted
14594,And finish it!,Barney
14595,It's all yours.,Robin
14596,"No. To you, I insist.",Ted
14597,"Okay, I will.",Robin
14598,"Great. Wait, what?",Ted
14599,I say I'll slap.,Robin
14600,"What, so it's... the end of the discussion?",Ted
14601,You said I could slap.,Robin
14602,"I was polite. If someone will slap, it will be me.",Ted
14603,"No, not at all.",Robin
14604,This is interesting.,Barney
14605,It's your family. And I'm sorry but we do not separate the family.,Marshall
14606,"It's easy for you to say that, you come to the family the most ridiculously close to the world.",Lily
14607,It is not ridiculously close.,Marshall
14608,Really? And the Eriksen family dinner every Sunday?,Lily
14609,I'm sorry but it's weird.,Lily
14610,A family must be close like that. And I want our future family is. And that includes your father.,Marshall
14611,"I can not believe you take her part. Let me be clear. This man will never set foot in this house, ever!",Lily
14612,It will take about 5 minutes.,Marshall
14613,It's a disease?,Marshall
14614,"We have one hour before sunset, and none of us baffera Barney.",Robin
14615,Let me do it. It was my idea to call the objects found in the prefecture.,Ted
14616,It's a good point. Rebuttal?,Barney
14617,I slipped a note of the type 20!,Robin
14618,philosophical riddle. Idea against execution. Itemize your arguments.,Barney
14619,I brought this large turkey so far.,Ted
14620,I paid the taxi.,Robin
14621,You've slept with one of my best friends!,Ted
14622,What? You said it was fine.,Robin
14623,"Well, no!",Ted
14624,Why did not you say anything?,Robin
14625,Because I love you always!,Ted
14626,You really want to slap Barney the point of lying and pretending to be in love with me?,Robin
14627,I really want to slap!,Ted
14628,"Your father has made mistakes in the past, but it has changed. He moved out of your grandparents. He has a job. He pays his taxes.",Marshall
14629,"Wait, how you know all this?",Lily
14630,"Gender, body language. Okay, we had a drink last week.",Marshall
14631,"Yeah, kind, all the time. She tells this story all the time...",Marshall
14632,"No, not a word. But that does not have to be like that.We can fix that, right?",Marshall
14633,"And right before my eyes, your father broke down in tears. (Actually, it's Marshall who starts crying) Stop it! You come to Thanksgiving!",Marshall
14634,You've invited?!,Lily
14635,"The poor man was sobbing. What could I do? A fool and called him a girl, what I found unjustified.",Marshall
14636,I do not believe you. What gives you the right to do that?,Lily
14637,You and I are married. So it is also part of my family.(Marshall will open the door for the third time) Enter.,Marshall
14638,It must be half an hour. We should get Lily.,Marshall
14639,Repeat-a. The first seven!,Barney
14640,Robin Shit! I knew Barney first. This is for me to slap.,Ted
14641,"This slap is mine, Mosby. I never slap Barney... above the belt.",Robin
14642,I want to slap Barney since I met him!,Ted
14643,And I would not slap?,Robin
14644,"One second. This slap was supposed to be a wonderful thing, a gift, and it has turned against each other.",Ted
14645,"My God, you're right. This fruit has changed in immaculate slap-poisoned apple. You know what? Seriously, do it.",Robin
14646,Are you sure?,Ted
14647,Baffe-solument.,Robin
14648,We should really get Lily.,Marshall
14649,"It's decided. Barney, go. Come on the throne.",Ted
14650,You're gonna...,Barney
14651,Yep. Go.,Ted
14652,"I guess this is the best choice, Robin. Finally... the men are stronger than women.",Barney
14653,Do not listen. It's decided.,Ted
14654,"And that's what you always wanted, is not it? A strong man to take care of you? Of course, teenager, you were a feisty, playing hockey with the boys, you skinned your knees on the ice. But what you could say to your teammates... or even to yourself... that is all you really wanted was this pretty white dress in this beautiful white chapel. And at the end of the aisle strewn with pretty white flowers, a man to take care of all your slaps.",Barney
14655,Leads to me!,Robin
14656,Robin! Pull yourself together! (The timer sounds and &quot;something sprung from the game) What just happened?,Ted
14657,You come here and you watch your daughter go without care. And now you destroy the Thanksgiving dinner! Lily is on it since this morning!,Marshall
14658,You have swallowed this painting?,Ted
14659,This is my look &quot;you're dead to me.&quot;,Marshall
14660,Get out of my house!,Marshall
14661,"In Mr. Park... I was not expecting to find you here. Lily, I'm sorry. Just let me express myself. I thought the family was right but it's wrong. It is a privilege, and it deserves it. I put your father out. And I promise you, baby, I do... you never force her to see him again. (Lily starts to cry) What? Baby, what has happened?",Marshall
14662,"Marshall, I came here because I was cold and it was the only place that was open. I would not even look at Mr. Park in the eye. And then I discovered that... Mr. Park's death. He really died for me. And if I feel so bad to have never forgiven Mr. Park, a guy who literally did not mean anything to me? We have to get my father.",Lily
14663,"Commissioner of the bet-Baffe, tie me to the chair is a violation...",Barney
14664,"Less talking shop, more slaps.",Lily
14665,You just 2 minutes. You decided which of you will be entitled to a slap in the face to Barney?,Marshall
14666,It's gonna be Ted.,Robin
14667,What? Why me?,Ted
14668,"Last year you were abandoned at the altar. You lost your job. You did so along way. I am so proud of you, Ted. You deserve to slap someone in the face as hard as you can.",Robin
14669,Thank you.,Ted
14670,This is the worst.,Barney
14671,"You just go through a break... and even though I know that you and Barney are remained on good terms, there is not a part of you, well hidden that wants to slap in the face?",Ted
14672,Yes,Robin
14673,I know.,Ted
14674,It's downright hell.,Barney
14675,Okay.,Ted
14676,It hurts!,Barney
14677,"I can not do it. I can not take that away from you, Ted.",Robin
14678,I do not either.,Ted
14679,thank you God.,Barney
14680,"So, I want to move. Mickey?",Robin
14681,No way!,Barney
14682,"I'm glad you and Lily try to fix things. You want to welcome into our family, I would like to offer you the slap.",Robin
14683,Gently!,Barney
14684,thank you God.,Barney
14685,You're kidding me.,Barney
14686,"No. No, no, no, no. It is the Commissioner of the bet-Baffe. It must remain impartial!",Barney
14687,The Commissioner of the bet-Baffe says it's good.,Lily
14688,It's not good. Please... Let me...,Barney
14689,Close your eyes. It will soon be over.,Lily
14690,I'm running in a meadow.,Barney
14691,I can not do it. Why I can not do it?,Lily
14692,Because... the slap did exactly what I hoped. It brought us together. And it forced us to recognize the weakness and at the same time the greatness in ourselves and in others.,Marshall
14693,Stop your bullshit.,Barney
14694,And so... there will not slap... of... today.,Marshall
14695,This is the best Thanksgiving...,Barney
14696,4! So the turkey?,Marshall
14697,"Well, I received another.",Marshall
14698,What's there in the box? What there was in the boiiite?What there was in the boiiiiiite?! What there was in the boiiiiiiite?! Not bad eh? Nothing. I'm the idiot huh? What there was in the box?,Robin
14699,"Since Lily and Marshall have their apartment, her mother keeps sending him old things she wants to get rid.",Ted
14700,"Well done 'man, right on target this time. I really needed the right arm of Himan, and this old book of Mad Libs.Pet went to fart to fart loud. This is good. Thank you 'man.",Marshall
14701,Hello?,Ted
14702,Yes.,Ted
14703,What?,Ted
14704,The window is open.,Ted
14705,"What are you waiting for? Ted, run!",Marshall
14706,"Lily, the window is open. Fight your way, watercourse Ted, run!",Ted
14707,"Hey, Maggie. I was just, you know, hmm... How are you?",Ted
14708,"Oh, sorry for you. Wanna go out tonight?",Ted
14709,"Come on, tell me that happened to you on time?",Marshall
14710,I arrived!,Ted
14711,What's happening? What is this window?,Robin
14712,"You see how everyone knows a person, and whatever happens, this person is perfect for you.",Ted
14713,My cats.,Robin
14714,Lily.,Marshall
14715,That girl over there.,Barney
14716,Well this girl was and still is Maggie Wilks.,Ted
14717,"We went to college together, she's great. Everybody liked him.",Marshall
14718,Oh I know what we do here. Tell me when it stops.,Barney
14719,It was not the fact that Maggie was good. It was the...,Ted
14720,It was the perfect girl next door.,Marshall
14721,"It was the perfect girl next door. And still is. All the guys who meet Maggie fall madly in love with her. And that's the problem. Since I know her, she has been single for only three short windows of time.",Ted
14722,"When she moved here and broke up with her boyfriend in college, I waited one month, not to go for the spare wheel. And the spare wheel well, he stayed two years. After their breakup, I have waited a week. Late again. She stayed with guys for 3 years.",Ted
14723,"The third time, I was super fast. I got not even one hour after their breakup. The only thing she has made between the break and I arrived, it's down to her mail.",Ted
14724,"Late again. And she went out with him four years. I would not let me have it again. So I begged her neighbor, Ms. Doglas, call me when she and David have broken loose.",Ted
14725,"And now, a single and Maggie is available along the way to this bar right now. I made him take a taxi with a woman driver for there is no interaction with a man, so far.",Ted
14726,"Even when I arrived here, she still will not touch with a man. I feel good tonight, this evening will be well.",Barney
14727,"This is my overalls. I wore this little baby, during high school.",Marshall
14728,"Hey, you were really a virgin before he met Lily.",Robin
14729,It was not necessary.,Marshall
14730,"She's right baby, if you had worn it in college, even I would not have slept with you. And if you remember, I wanted to.",Lily
14731,"No way, no one could sleep while wearing it. Challenge accepted. I, Barney Stinson, brilliant mind in an extraordinary body, this will overalls, and lie with a woman.",Barney
14732,I went out with this guy.,Robin
14733,"Ok, game plan Maggie arrives, a few minutes of gathering and presentation, and everyone leaves us. This is my only chance, and I will not go wrong.",Ted
14734,You do not give a lecture tonight?,Robin
14735,Damn!,Ted
14736,"Oh my God, good evening.",Lily
14737,"I want you to Maggie Robin, my roommate.",Ted
14738,Likewise.,Robin
14739,"I completely forgot, I teach a class tonight. How would you like to come and see what happens during an architecture?",Ted
14740,"Super. Sit down, put yourself at ease. Relaxed, everything is relaxed. Listen, you want me to find the perfect girl for you so all together, it's her. Do not let a guy to approach her. No server to take our order, clean the table, and if it ignites, I want a female firefighter to extinguish.",Ted
14741,I think that emergencies are taking applications like that.,Marshall
14742,"Marshall Good God, do what you need to keep single until my return. I pay the bill, but do not abuse.",Ted
14743,Target secure?,Marshall
14744,Target secure.,Lily
14745,"Wow, weird, pulled out all the toilets at the same time.",Marshall
14746,Let's go to the table all together.,Lily
14747,"Look at that, our table.",Marshall
14748,Your challenge not interest me but you're cheating. Wear a suit under the overalls.,Robin
14749,"No. They are called not on the shirt, or on t-shirts for wholesale repairing the car and my mother spent some time with her top. They are called overalls, and I can relate to what I want.",Barney
14750,"Oh it does not tell you goodnight, he tells you how he feeds his horses. I could sit there and tell jokes Farmer on you all night. Challenge accepted.",Robin
14751,"Good evening, tonight we will quickly see the different bridges. There are 6 types of bridges, small, large, with suspension and three others. You land on each side and water in the middle. See you next week.",Ted
14752,Who wants to hear me talk about bridges for 1 hour? (All raise their hands) Really?,Ted
14753,I just remembered how Ted is awesome.,Lily
14754,I offer you a drink?,Barney
14755,It was a big tractor 3-axis.,Robin
14756,What do I do?,Barney
14757,One important thing to remember when designing a bridge.,Ted
14758,No. Finally yes. When you design a bridge remember: &quot;Make Adjustments... Fetch energetically&quot; (&quot;Make Ajustments Energize Go Get It&quot; Maggie acronym in English) Good advice in general too.,Ted
14759,"No, I mean it's just that girl that interests me very long time.And tonight this is my chance to get away with it.",Ted
14760,"Yes Jamie, she is very pretty. We can now finish the course. Betty?",Ted
14761,"Bluntly. I think. Perhaps. I dunno, you think what?",Ted
14762,"Oh my God, I had totally forgotten that.",Marshall
14763,A duty that day of my 15 years. Write a letter to your future you with a list of things you hope to do. &quot;Dear Future Me...&quot;,Marshall
14764,"&quot;... you better drive a camaro or a super van. This is priority numero uno. And your ponytail should happen to you at the knees. You can always dunk course and change your name to &quot;Vanilla Thunder&quot;. Your wife, girlfriend, 1m80, a great body and take care of yourself. &quot;",Marshall
14765,Sorry darling.,Marshall
14766,"No problem, you just described your mother.",Lily
14767,"&quot;You still wear overalls faded because it looks torn.And more importantly, you better save the world, and if you became a poor guy then throw yourself off a cliff, because you suck. And I &quot;Licky boom boom down&quot;.",Marshall
14768,"Yes that's right, it's hilarious, I became a business poor guy. I work for GNB, the bank most unhealthy existence.",Marshall
14769,"I remember in college, Maggie wanted to be a marine biologist by day and tutor children in difficulty at night. What you ended up doing?",Lily
14770,"Baby, where you going?",Lily
14771,"I have to do something at work, it will not be long.",Marshall
14772,"Oh no, I think he'll resign. Sorry Maggie, I have to go stop him. (Lily comes out in pursuit of Marshall, leaving Maggie alone. A man turns to Maggie) Ted I had to leave the bar but it's good she is with Robin.",Lily
14773,You're left with Maggie Robin?,Ted
14774,"Relax, everything is under control.",Robin
14775,"You do not understand, this girl is like a magnet to men... k*ll.",Ted
14776,I know a little something about loving to men... you see me as one of those magnets that can not put a picture of your children on the fridge. But I am one of these magnets... that can pick up cars in scrap yards...! (Robin returns to the table where she finds a man with Maggie) Who is it?,Robin
14777,"Oh, well... hello you!",Robin
14778,"What does mean to be ready? I thought I was ready last year and I was left on the altar. I'll be honest. I'm scared! Ok, Luis and Betty!",Ted
14779,"I mean, if you're not afraid you do not try your luck... and if you do not try your luck then... What are you doing? Not?",Ted
14780,"Funny? I think it's hilarious. In fact, I liked so much that I think I'm pissed.",Robin
14781,I'd love to!,Robin
14782,"Ok, I gotta go!",Ted
14783,Hello?,Ted
14784,"Ted, change of plans!",Robin
14785,You let him with Barney?,Ted
14786,"Ted, will you calm down? I'm your pal!",Barney
14787,You're an animal!,Ted
14788,"And I know our relationship has suffered in this area, I assure you I'll be the perfect gentleman.",Barney
14789,"You have 10 minutes to get here, the window closes.",Barney
14790,10 minutes?,Ted
14791,"Yeah, because we're friends!",Barney
14792,"Oh, it's not possible! I love pictures of dogs ironic. You got it there with the dog Welsh dwarf who is a missionary?",Robin
14793,"And if you took a glass of wine first? (It shatters his glass on it voluntarily) Oooh boy! I'm dirty, it's me! I'm just a dirty, dirty girl... that would defeat the second base with a friend of a friend.Tui love it! It's pig!",Robin
14794,"Oh my God, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie. Leave her alone!Lord, she goes out with Ted tonight.",Robin
14795,They have broken.,Robin
14796,It tells me nothing!,Robin
14797,Hey baby! I thought you came here to resign... I forgot the basket.,Lily
14798,"Yeah, I thought so... so I got to do something on this list I will feel more so old so I... I came here to dunk.",Marshall
14799,Do it helped you feel better?,Lily
14800,I just touches the bottom of the net. You know my legs are so bad that I have a hard time getting approved.,Marshall
14801,Really...,Barney
14802,How could you?,Ted
14803,"I'm challenged to have sex with overalls. And if you stay on my path, then you let Barney win. And you do not want that!This place will never tell us the end of history.",Barney
14804,Put yourself on the line Bob!,Ted
14805,"Yeah, I'll sleep with her. After, he'll tell her he loves her.And you can do... what you want. Is there agreement on the order?",Barney
14806,I'm in love with her for 12 years!,Ted
14807,I wear this jumpsuit since 1:30!,Barney
14808,"Maybe you can not dunk now. But you did more in 30 years that this 15 year old could have dreamed. You are a graduate of law. You had the good sense to cut you that stupid ponytail. And, you married this super b*mb that is unlike any points to your mother. This entitles you to 30 cm less to dunk. (She drops a little basket) Go ahead Thunder vanilla!",Lily
14809,remote!,Marshall
14810,"Oh, Baby! And if instead of going to dunk on your desk... you allongeras and I'd put the banana oil everywhere?",Lily
14811,Sure baby. Why we would not do that here?,Marshall
14812,Sure baby.,Lily
14813,"Guys, guys, guys! We must fix that.",Ted
14814,"Guys, let me assure you that if you let me... the window will reopen in about 10 minutes.",Barney
14815,"Wait, where is Maggie?",Ted
14816,She's gone!,Robin
14817,What?,Ted
14818,I told him to return. You were like vultures... fighting for his carcass. Let her be single for once.,Robin
14819,"Wait, she's right. Maggie deserves a little time for her.Nobody likes to be alone, especially after a break but... This is where we discover who we really are... and what you really want. She deserves it!",Ted
14820,"Oh, sorry, the course we had a little... Who is it?",Ted
14821,"Yeah, sure!",Ted
14822,Well... I'll see you next time!,Ted
14823,"Well, I found! There are bars country, &quot;the giddy ups&quot;, there are tons of guys in overalls. Copilot me!",Barney
14824,I do not want the &quot;giddy ups.&quot; That's what I want. I had forgotten how it felt to seeking the real thing... but I think I'm ready again.,Ted
14825,"Let me tell you where I am... I want to sleep with a girl in order to remove this jumpsuit. (From Ted) Go, go. You gotta help me, I have to remove this damn thing.",Barney
14826,"Dear Marshall 60 years... Now you would work in a place that contributes to a better world. Or at least you try. No pressure man! I mean, sir. So... If time travel is possible, could you give me a little sign? Tuesday, December 8 at 8:29 p.m.....",Marshall
14827,"Someone sent these chicken wings because they were too hot. I do... too hot, you're crazy? So chicken wings free.",Lily

14829,Mike? Wake up!,Robin
14830,Have you seen my show?,Robin
14831,"I wanted to watch it but I was too busy sleeping with this story. It took me all night, after 8 hours of the clock.",Ted
14832,"It's not serious, but listen to this! After the show...",Robin
14833,Yes.,Robin
14834,"Wow, you're going you do too.",Ted
14835,"No, I just think it will be great both on the air.",Robin
14836,"And on the couch, the bed and on the coffee table.",Ted
14837,"Ok, ok, I'll go on the roof and stay there all alone 5 minutes.",Robin
14838,Have fun.,Ted
14839,"Okay, okay, I'll go smoke a cigarette.",Robin
14840,I just let something like that to my apartment.,Barney
14841,"Robin, going, going on the roof! We said no smoking in the apartment... after that you have set fire by the pumps.",Ted
14842,"Okay, very good, very good.",Robin
14843,"Yeah Robin, I mean my God... not only is it a bad habit but... Do I have one?",Marshall
14844,Of course.,Robin

15106,"This is a new lawyer in the office of Marshall, he is hilarious.",Lily
15107,"Hilarious! There was a jar of cherries in the fridge, then Jenkins said: $ 200 and I eat the whole pot. So we gave him $ 200, and he ate the whole jar!",Marshall
15108,"The CFO comes to sign papers, then Jenkins said: Excuse me Mr Wilkocs, I think we forgot one of the documents.We all went to a bar after work, Jenkins goes on the table and begins to gesticulate like a stripper, and a second later, he removes his shirt. It was so disgusting.",Marshall
15109,"Well it feels good to finally meet the famous Jenkins, after all these stories.",Ted

15128,I'm in a hurry to meet him.,Lily
15129,"I should correct, it would have been so simple.",Marshall
15130,"But I have not done. So now, whenever I talk about Jenkins, I avoid pronouns.",Marshall

15157,It is Jenkins.,Marshall
15158,You are Jenkins?,Lily
15159,"The famous Jenkins, gosh. I imagined a man, in short, we eat?",Lily
15160,"Wait, you're not jealous at all?",Marshall
15161,"Honey, I do not have to worry about you and another woman.",Lily
15162,"Because we love to madness, right?",Marshall
15163,Yes of course. Let's eat.,Lily
15164,It was not jealous at all.,Marshall
15165,"Of course she was not jealous, it is the dynamics of your relationship.",Ted
15166,What is this supposed to mean?,Marshall
15167,"That's how it goes boy, every relationship has a low and high.",Robin
15168,"Exactly, low in trying to conquer another out of reach, and the strong will go back down to be with the other person less.",Ted
15169,"I am not diminished for Lily. Yes, it is a bit small, and my mother says she has no hips to carry a baby Eriksen. My God, you think I'm weak.",Marshall
15170,"That's why Lily is not jealous. The strongest is never jealous because where could go lower? The fort, Lily, is the best thing that low, Marshall may have hoped.",Robin
15171,"No, ok, I'm glad Lily, but Lily is as lucky as me. None of us is low.",Marshall
15172,"Yes, it's definitely, you are going to buy a horse.",Robin
15173,What?,Marshall
15174,Try your luck.,Robin
15175,"So, to end modern architecture is very short, experimented with the houses in V. (Robin enters the classroom Ted) Excuse me one second. What are you doing here?",Ted
15176,"I've realized that you forgot something this morning, so I thought I would bring thee: thy pen.",Robin
15177,"It's your pen, and you have chewed the end, recently.",Ted
15178,"Nothing to Ted, your course was on my way to work.",Robin
15179,"No, it is not.",Ted
15180,"Come on, stand New York.",Robin
15181,"Really, you watch my show? You flatter me see. Other fans here?",Robin
15182,"Thank you for last, Robin.",Ted
15183,"That night, great show on poisons. (She goes out, then reopens the door) Also, who makes the worst pizza in New York, I will give you information on traffic streets 5 and 9.",Robin
15184,"Really? You watch his show? It's like watching an aquarium lit, and less interesting. And now that I think, not even informed.",Ted
15185,The what?,Ted
15186,But huh?,Barney
15187,"But um, it would seem, she often said.",Ted
15188,"It's funny, I also had a drinking game based on Robin, Robin finally. At the bottom of her stomach...",Barney
15189,It was agreed that you do not speak of those things.,Ted
15190,"Sorry, you're right. She did not like anyway. She said it woke her up. Does she said &quot;But um&quot; so often?",Barney
15191,"It's good but um, this was not your first spelling bee, does not it?",Robin
15192,Oh that's good. But hmm. But um...,Robin
15193,Interesting article in the newspaper. They say that in every relationship there is a weak and strong.,Marshall
15194,Let me see.,Lily
15195,"It's not that one, it's in another, I've read before. The newspaper reminded me of the old. In short, what do you think?",Marshall
15196,I think sometimes it's the case.,Lily
15197,But not for us?,Marshall
15198,"No, of course not.",Lily
15199,"Sure. Imagine, you have a g*n to his head, you have to say that one of us is low.",Marshall
15200,"I would say this is me, this is what is right.",Lily
15201,"Now, the g*n is pointed at me, and our future children, and our future little monkeys. Depends on who wins the game is played for 3 years.",Marshall
15202,"No, no weak or strong.",Lily
15203,So this...,Marshall
15204,"Our two children, our 8 grandchildren, 11 great grandchildren our, our plane piloted by Oprah, and it is poised to spits at an art museum that contains all your favorite pictures, and the only way save everything, and answered: Art thou the weak or strong?",Marshall
15205,And Oprah has tried everything?,Lily
15206,Everything you need to decide now.,Marshall
15207,"I think if I had to really say, maybe I'm strong.",Lily
15208,How can you say such a thing!,Marshall
15209,"She thinks she is strong. That's right, I have to prove that I am not the weak. I will make her jealous.",Marshall
15210,"Easy, that's the plan: A, layer with Jenkins. Two, I sleep with Jenkins first. Three, the second rule is the first I'm going to rule 2.",Barney
15211,"Okay, I know. You remember the other night, the game of skee-ball, when you did your good score?",Ted
15212,"Yes, an ordinary night for the &quot;Big caramel.&quot;",Marshall
15213,Do you think she was flirting with me?,Marshall
15214,Bluntly.,Ted
15215,"Sure, I have an opening. If Madame Lily is jealous, young Marshall can not move, then by chance, the &quot;Big caramel&quot;... may move, ok let me try again.",Marshall
15216,"Okay, I understand.",Ted
15217,"Ted, I have a great idea.",Robin
15218,Remove your hair in the bathtub once you're done? Looks like you want to make a bath mat.,Ted
15219,"If you want to make one of your classes exciting, I could read it from someone a little more fun, your students can pay attention and learn.",Robin
15220,"Oh, you're entertaining? Last night there were 3 minutes of silence where you tried to patch up your sweater.",Ted
15221,"Look, just because your class prefers me to you...",Robin
15222,... You're a drinking game.,Ted
15223,What?,Robin
15224,"That's why they watch. They did a drinking game on you.Every time you say &quot;But um&quot;, they take a sh*t.",Ted
15225,But umm?,Robin
15226,Yes.,Ted
15227,"I'm not But um, I never told But hum.",Robin
15228,"So I guess it's not a great drinking game. This means that last night when we played with Barney, I was not drunk and I did not vomit on it. Except that I did these two things here, take this.",Ted
15229,Hey Jenkins!,Marshall
15230,"So, Lily and I go back to university bar. And you wonder if maybe you would come... You could watch me play skee-ball... do exactly what you did the other night, something like that. It's really up to you, I mean...",Marshall
15231,"Hey baby, what do you do at home?",Lily
15232,"Baby! That is, it's a name I do not deserve.",Marshall
15233,What?,Lily
15234,"Oh, I see what happens. That's about all that history of strong and weak.",Lily
15235,You're sure it's not a fever?,Marshall
15236,You wanna make me jealous so you invent a story with Jenkins.,Lily
15237,"I did not invent it! It happened, this woman kissed me.With language, his tongue was in my mouth.",Marshall
15238,Of course it was.,Lily
15239,It was silky... and hard as a branch of starfish,Marshall
15240,"I'm so jealous, I'll go see it and hit right on the nose... like an old sandwich. Come on baby, you want some soup?",Lily
15241,It happened! Have you... meatballs?,Marshall
15242,And here's a few of his contributions to architecture and now... We remember him for just one thing. My friends this is the sad legacy of Gregorio... Franchetti Gazibo. Questions?,Ted
15243,What?,Ted
15244,"Well, what can I say except... um But I am! I can always come? I will pay?",Ted
15245,"So, your third book is your new novel, but um...",Robin
15246,"Shit! Sorry. But, but just. No hum! Your first book was written more quickly?",Robin
15247,But umm...,Robin
15248,It's not pretty!,Ted
15249,"I wanted to ask about the novel you're writing right now, but um...",Robin
15250,"And tonight, you had to, but um...",Robin
15251,"For a long time, but um...",Robin
15252,"No, no, no, do not drink, it's a trap!",Ted
15253,"Ok, um... but thank you for coming but um... If there are students who look, but um, but um, but um...",Robin
15254,"My God, help us all!",Ted
15255,It's nothing.,Marshall
15256,It was not me!,Marshall
15257,You were drunk at 8am?,Marshall
15258,The police officer was unharmed but um...,Robin
15259,Happy to have you helped you remember.,Marshall
15260,It's nothing!,Marshall
15261,"No, who am I to say? Lily? I said to Lily.",Marshall
15262,"No, no!",Marshall
15263,"No, I... Yes! Yes! Do it!",Marshall
15264,"And if you got no time for all this, just tell him that it happened and that you're sorry. And if you're really in a hurry did not tell him you're sorry. Just as it happened, what is most important. It really happened. Thus abbreviated it as much as you can.",Marshall
15265,"Well, it happened! What will we do? It happened!Terrible, like you said. It happened!",Marshall
15266,Kissed my husband! MY HUSBAND! Nobody embraces the father of my future children besides me.,Lily
15267,"Marshall, you're in the field!",Barney
15268,Lil '? It's good!,Marshall
15269,So we'll just have a quiet day course. Nobody is talking! No noise!,Ted
15270,How's you all?,Robin
15271,"No, no, no, please. Just goes away!",Ted
15272,I just wanted to tell you go... (She takes a megaphone) To all those watching. Go! Standing New York! BUT HUM!,Robin
15273,"Thank you, Jim. I'm glad to be back on the show.",Barney
15274,"Hold on, Jimbo, it is extraordinary.",Barney
15275,It all started when I decided to start a small challenge.,Barney
15276,Oh my God. Wow.,Marshall
15277,He decides his v*ctim.,Ted
15278,Whatever the girl I'm trying to point is that I go with her tonight. And... they're off!,Barney
15279,Hi!,Marshall
15280,Hi!,Robin
15281,How did it go with Dale?,Lily
15282,"You know, sometimes, the guy with thick glasses and a t-shirt of the Smurfs, it's just a cliche. And sometimes it is a moron with a squint and a platonic relationship with Gargamel.",Robin
15283,"Robin, this is not because a guy talks a lot about a fictional character for your first date it can not be your future.",Lily
15284,The Yeti is not fictitious.,Marshall
15285,"Jim, there is nothing in my usual way to pack.",Barney
15286,"That brings us to the second night. You see the b*mb that pampers its Black Russian (Vodka and coffee liqueur)? She left to exchange it with a White American. Enter me five! You know... If you're not careful, you'll lose me.",Barney
15287,"Guys, when Dale called for a second hot date, what do I tell her?",Robin
15288,How do you know he'll call?,Marshall
15289,"How cute, Marshall. But I think mom knows when she was a hit. I mean, he could not help but look at me.",Robin
15290,"And well, do not push too. People can be fragile. And sometimes, without even trying, you can tear someone's heart, and crush it in front of a roomful of 26 people and a teacher's assistant.",Ted
15291,"How it happened at school today, Ted?",Lily
15292,Something bad happened. This was the first course of the semester...,Ted
15293,"Jamie Adamic. Salvation. Brian Glow-atz. Glau-atz?Salvation. Well done. Add a false name on the call sheet, very original guys. You know, I expected a little maturity, coming from students like you, and frankly, more creative. I mean, seriously, what kind of fake name is Jen Coulin?",Ted
15294,"Come on guys, you would have at least been able to make it sound right. Jen Coulin?",Ted
15295,"What happened to classic? Sat Troulcu, Ted and Bill Oukoi, Maby Stoukette, Roland Cule, that's false names, but Jen Coulin?",Ted
15296,Jen Coulin!,Ted
15297,"Come on, I wait, swing all your jokes about Jen Coulin.",Ted
15298,"We will not make jokes, Ted. I mean, this girl must really be in the hole.",Lily
15299,You really soiled the name of Jen Coulin.,Marshall
15300,Have you finished?,Ted
15301,You asked him if she had reached the right exit?,Robin
15302,"Wow, two in a row, Barney is thoroughly.",Lily
15303,"This is a lucky girl, Barney was my best sh*t.",Robin
15304,And this is the best friend I ever had.,Ted
15305,It is everything I love that Marshall either.,Lily
15306,It's all I want to be.,Marshall
15307,I guess that's just what they said when I was gone.,Barney
15308,"Jim, I can tell you that I was gone, so I wanted a little spice.",Barney
15309,I think I'll take small tits tonight.,Barney
15310,You're yucky.,Lily
15311,"Lily, it's people too.",Barney
15312,thank you.,Marshall
15313,Thank you.,Lily
15314,You share it? Your share forever.,Ted
15315,Of course not!,Lily
15316,There is no such Bizarros who share everything.,Marshall
15317,Of course I do.,Robin
15318,That's exactly what you are.,Ted
15319,It is perfectly normal.,Lily
15320,What's happening guys?,Robin
15321,"You know, Lily and I was looking for a new couple of friends since we lost Robin and Barney, and Ted and Stella and Ted and Robin, and Ted... Ted and Victoria, when do you arrive to keep one?",Marshall
15322,How we came up with that?,Ted
15323,"It was a great day out at 4 it was cool, we were relaxed, it was not freaked out.",Lily
15324,"And there, a tiny detail has surfaced, and it ruined the whole evening.",Marshall
15325,"It's crazy that last week, it happened the same with our toothbrushes.",Marshall
15326,Our toothbrush?,Ted
15327,Yeah.,Lily
15328,"As in, a toothbrush? You use both?",Robin
15329,That's weird?,Lily
15330,"Marshall, 4 of 5 dentists have just vomited on.",Ted
15331,"Hey, look, Barney has yet fallen one.",Robin
15332,"Wow. 3 girls in 3 nights. This is gross, even from Barney.",Lily
15333,Yuck? Are you kidding? There is no one left to do...,Ted
15334,Do not tell! You're going to jinx him!,Marshall
15335,Wear what bad luck?,Lily
15336,I had left to do... flawless.,Barney
15337,"It was faultless. 7 nights, 7 girls, 0 rejection.",Barney
15338,Yeah. The only player in history to have accomplished both Pete was Drexell 'The mustache' in 1896.,Barney
15339,You and me in the closet of the Spanish supermarket next door.,Barney
15340,"I can even say, without a fault. I'd love to say the same of my friends.",Barney
15341,Jen has not come into being today.,Ted
15342,"Excuse me, Jen?",Marshall
15343,"Yeah, Ted, we know tons of people who call Jen.",Robin
15344,Yeah.,Marshall
15345,Jen Coulin.,Ted
15346,"Oh, you're there. The dreaded call from Dale. Oh, that's my mother. She has big health problems. But why does he not call?",Robin
15347,Wait a second. Want it called?,Lily
15348,No! Shut up! You have not a kind of toothbrush to share or something like that?,Robin
15349,Yeah. When did you start doing that too?,Ted
15350,"It's been years! You had to know, you lived with us.",Marshall
15351,"Yeah, but you always keep your toothbrush in the bathroom, which is, incidentally, also weird.",Ted
15352,We kept her in the bathroom.,Lily
15353,"No, there was a toothbrush in the bathroom, and it was mine.",Ted
15354,"Wait. Are you saying that for 8 years, you have shared a toothbrush every 3?",Robin
15355,Oh my god!,Marshall
15356,Finish me!,Ted
15357,I'm having so much!,Robin
15358,"Well done, Jim.",Barney
15359,Beer! Salvation.,Ted
15360,Hi. How is Barney?,Marshall
15361,Like a charm. As all week.,Ted
15362,Yeah? Hard to believe.,Marshall
15363,Why?,Ted
15364,"Apparently, this big merger last week went wrong, and Barney wears the hat.",Marshall
15365,"Oh, it's weird. He said nothing.",Lily
15366,"Even I who works with him, I just learned this afternoon when I walked past the office of his boss.",Marshall
15367,I never thought about Barney so scared.,Marshall
15368,I think he'll get fired.,Marshall
15369,I can not believe that Barney is going to get fired.,Ted
15370,"Yeah, they have a meeting Friday to see if he keeps his job or not.",Marshall
15371,Poor guy. It must pinball.,Robin
15372,I'll go talk to him.,Lily
15373,No! You can not distract a man who is right... you know what.,Ted
15374,"Come on, it's his career. This is much more important than a stupid without...",Lily
15375,"Ahh! Okay. You can lick my hand all you want, I will not let you ruin... Ouch!",Marshall
15376,It must go talk to him.,Lily
15377,I'm going. He needs a brother. Hey buddy.,Ted
15378,Hey!,Barney
15379,Is everything okay?,Ted
15380,Absolutely. A background. It could not get better. I make fun of that? I need you.,Barney
15381,Anything you want. What's the matter?,Ted
15382,Which of these girls look the most stupid?,Barney
15383,Let's see it. Already heated to perfection? The smashed out? Ok I will deal for Big Mac.,Ted
15384,"Thank you, Skip.",Barney
15385,So what did he say?,Lily
15386,"What? Oh, it will try with the girl holding the burger there.",Ted
15387,You were supposed to talk about his loss of job.,Lily
15388,"Lily, why is that force him to face a problem that can not adjust will help?",Ted
15389,And why ignore it will fix things?,Lily
15390,You're much ignored the problems of dental hygiene for a dozen years. And yet you seem to...,Ted
15391,Jen Coulin!,Lily
15392,Jen Coulin.,Robin
15393,Dale you called?,Ted
15394,Why do you...,Robin
15395,"Guys, guys, look!",Marshall
15396,"No, sir. I like to play by the rules. While I can not say I did not propose to.",Barney
15397,It was pretty awesome. You should try it. I still have a few.,Marshall
15398,No thank you.,Barney
15399,"You sure? Ok, do as you like. What time is it?",Marshall
15400,It's 8:00.,Barney
15401,8:00? I have to go to hospital.,Marshall
15402,"I've never touched. I can pee in a jar if you like, Jim Nantz.",Barney
15403,... seriously guys.,Ted
15404,Hey!,Marshall
15405,"Hey, what are you doing here? Returns to the bar!",Ted
15406,"Ted, relax. I am already 6 of 6.",Barney
15407,Really?,Ted
15408,"Yeah. I ate at the Tavern of vegetables, I started talking to the Swedish Top Model, and the next moment we batifolait in the back of a carriage. Go my beautiful, Hue!",Barney
15409,Great. What really happened?,Ted
15410,"I ate at the &quot;Staten Island Chili's,&quot; and I jumped a hairdresser completely stuffed. Are you happy, Ulysses?",Barney
15411,"Barney, we know that you are going you may get fired. Wait, you ought to speak. You turn away from reality, kissing unnecessarily on all sides.",Lily
15412,"No vain, ok? Between number 5 and I, there was a connection. She will resume her studies, she has a child or who is studying... something with &quot;studies&quot;.",Barney
15413,Now my students have taught me that Jen Coulin abandon my material.,Ted
15414,"Oh, my God, you've really pushed to the limit.",Marshall
15415,It scales all his education in the toilet.,Robin
15416,News from Dale?,Ted
15417,"It's only been five days, he will call!",Robin
15418,What do you care? You said it was a big con.,Marshall
15419,"Tell Dale not like that, ok? It is twice as good as you never will!",Robin
15420,"God forbid, if you manage to find a job, sell your apartment.Marshall and I, we have a free room. You can stay as long as you want.",Lily
15421,Forget not you bring your toothbrush.,Robin
15422,"Lily, what are you doing?",Ted
15423,I talk to my friend who is going through a difficult period.,Lily
15424,He's doing very well.,Marshall
15425,"Try to sleep with seven women in seven nights, that's not what I would call &quot;very well get out.&quot; It is a cry for help.",Lily
15426,His whole life is a call for help. But we do not mess with a man who is in the midst of a no...,Ted
15427,"What? Without fault? Flawless, faultless, flawless! Grow up a little!",Lily
15428,"I do not know what to tell you, Lily is always trying to ruin me any.",Barney
15429,"You have the eye to notice such details, Jim Nantz.",Barney
15430,I can not believe that thou hast brought him bad luck.,Ted
15431,He has no chance.,Marshall
15432,"Ok, I have a question. If I ruined everything, why is it that Barney is in the process of hanging the girl three martinis in there?",Lily
15433,"Oh, my God!",Ted
15434,There's going to happen!,Marshall
15435,"Yeah, you know? Doors-jinx, it does not exist.",Lily
15436,I wish I had power.,Barney
15437,"Well, thank you to her, the only thing that can prevent a stroke insured was about to walk out the door. A member of the New York Yankees World Champions in 2009.",Barney
15438,"Lily, I'll buy my own toothbrush.",Marshall
15439,"Well, that's it. Barney's still got to 6.",Ted
15440,What? Why? Because the guy with the weird cut went back?,Robin
15441,This is Nick Swisher. It is part of the New York Yankees. No regular guy from New York can not compete with a Yankee.,Marshall
15442,"And this is true for a former Yankee. When I arrived here, I was the fourth date with a girl I loved a lot before I do the fly by Phil Rizzuto.",Ted
15443,"I was there. Damn, this guy could play.",Marshall
15444,I'm still not.,Robin
15445,"Ok, let me do it the Canadian So how do you react if one of those guys with skates and sticks came back here?",Lily
15446,"Lily, if one of the Vancouver Canucks came here, I fall on my ass so that there would be a hole halfway to China in the soil.",Robin
15447,It's the same thing for the Yankees.,Ted
15448,"Oh, Barney's done.",Robin
15449,"It's happening, look.",Marshall
15450,You wanna come to my house and watch the collection of snowballs?,Barney
15451,A collection of snow globes?,Marshall
15452,He is pinball.,Ted
15453,"It was well played, well played, well played.",Ted
15454,But not play well enough. All this week was a waste of time. And tomorrow I'm getting fired.,Barney
15455,"I'm sorry. But for what it's worth, this week was not a waste of time. We all had a horrible week, and you have helped us change a little air.",Marshall
15456,"Yeah, I got my first drop.",Ted
15457,"I met my soul mate, and he never called back. Well, not yet. He will. He will.",Robin
15458,We frightened a couple great just because we share a toothbrush.,Marshall
15459,You share a toothbrush?,Barney
15460,"Well, they and Ted.",Robin
15461,... Huh?,Barney
15462,"Wait a minute. When we went out together, you borrow the toothbrush all the time.",Ted
15463,"Oh, shit.",Robin
15464,"At the second she sits next to Swisher, we reach the end.",Ted
15465,"Wait a minute! Aldrin was seen. She tries to escape, she jumps, and... I thought she would not do that.",Marshall
15466,"Yeah, sorry. I'm so clumsy! Oh, thank you. I think I twisted my ankle. Do what you can bring me some ice?",Lily
15467,She did! I believe that there is no jinx finally.,Marshall
15468,Damn. Swisher is back in play Swisher is back in play!,Marshall
15469,"Follow me. Hey, Nick Swisher! This guy and his wife share a toothbrush!",Ted
15470,"And it's weird, right?",Ted
15471,"I'm sorry. Lily, Nick Swisher think it's cute.",Marshall

15479,What a c**t.,Barney
15480,I barely slept.,Barney
15481,"That's the guy, the official caps of no fault of Barney. I was going to make t-shirts, but you know, sizes, all that, and it would hurt me to think.",Marshall

15488,"Hey, guys!",Barney

15490,Does anyone know who won the Superbowl?,Barney
15491,You were there. It was the...,Marshall
15492,"I won! Because I'm now in possession of a magic phone that always rings. And you know who's always usually on the other end? A chick. So how many chicks do I have calling me now? Infinity! Guys, remember Ranjit?",Barney
15493,"Hey, Ranjit!",Ted
15494,Good to see you.,Marshall
15495,OK I've enlisted Ranjit's services as my personal driver because for the next week I'll be sleeping with hundreds of women and I don't want to take the subway cause... you know... germs!,Barney
15496,"Wait, you're... you're actually gonna hook up with these girls that call you?",Ted
15497,"Oh, indubitably! I'm meeting the first one here any minute. Keep your eyes pealed for a red sweater. Based on her texts, she's dirty, dyslexic and want to 96 me, semi-colon and parenthesis.",Barney

15505,"Something troubling you, kiddo?",Ted
15506,Hhhhh Don.,Robin
15507,Now that's what I call having a woof over your head. Don. DON?,Robin
15508,He asked you out?,Lily
15509,He asked me out.,Robin
15510,That's crazy! And they use &quot;Ulee&quot; because of the vowels.,Ted
15511,What did you say?,Marshall
15512,"Well we were on the air, I was on the spot, so I said OK.",Robin
15513,"Oh, oh, oh!",Lily
15514,"Robin, you're gonna marry this man so freaking hard, right in the butt.",Marshall
15515,What? Nooo I HATE Don. And now I can't cancel because I said I would go out with him on the air.,Robin
15516,What would your viewers think?,Marshall
15517,"Wow wow wow, you said you'd go out with him on Valentine's? I thought we had plans!",Ted
15518,Getting drunk and cleaning the apartment was a plan?,Robin
15519,I did NOT...say... it was a good plan.,Ted
15520,"Guys, guys, guys, we're on me now. And it is getting in-teh-resting. Looks at these texts. Read this one. Yowza! Now look at this one. Does she text her mother with those fingers? Now look at this one... or this one, or this one, or this one, or...",Barney
15521,"OK OK OK buddy, how about you do this? Go nail that girl, then read your texts.",Ted
15522,"I can't do that, Ted. I just can't hook up with a girl if there is a hotter girl out there with whom up can be hooked.",Barney
15523,Isn't there always a hotter girl?,Lily
15524,"I know, isn't it wonderful? <em>(answers phone)</em> Go for Barney. Cut to the chase, what's your cup size?...Oh, hi Mom!",Barney
15525,"So there's a hotter girl. Isn't that the problem in a nutshell? There's too many options. You got internet dating, you got bars...",Ted
15526,Holding up your phone number on national TV.,Lily
15527,Hm.,Ted
15528,It is true. It's very rare that two people just meet and fall madly in love... like Robin and Don.,Marshall
15529,"Oh but we're not even like going out for dinner, we're just hanging out at his place.",Robin
15530,"No, it's not like that. It's just us and a bunch of other people.",Robin
15531,"Wait, Robin, what exactly did Don say when he asked you out?",Lily
15532,Errrrrrr...I... OK.,Robin
15533,"Robin, Don didn't ask you out.",Lily
15534,"Err, of course he asked me out.",Robin
15535,Err no he didn't.,Ted
15536,"Yes, he did. He did. He did. He DID!",Robin
15537,"Well, dog my cats! I think I know what's going on here. Robin... did you WANT Don to ask out?",Marshall
15538,"Whaaat?!! <em>(in a high voice) (huffs)</em> Nooo, I HATE Don! I-I-I can't stop thinking how much I hate him, it's like, it's like... all the time. I just wanna attack him and rip his stupid clothes off and spank him with his little paddle until his bum's all red. SHUT UP!! <em>(leaves the table)</em>",Robin
15539,"See! That right there is what free will gets you. Constant ego-shattering uncertainty. I'm done with that. I want what Ranjit has. I've spent my entire adult life looking for the perfect woman and I'm spending Valentine's Day scrubbing the toilet. I need someone else to find me that woman. Marshall, Lily, arrange-marriage me!",Ted
15540,"<em>(walks by, phone ringing)</em>Or this one, or this one, or this one...",Barney
15541,You want us to arrange your marriage?,Marshall
15542,"Absolutely. Looks there's two sides to dating, right? Picking and getting picked. Getting picked, I'm good at. Ladies looove Teddy Westside.",Ted
15543,"You're waiting for me to comment on your self-assigned nickname? Well, here's my comment. I love it.",Marshall
15544,Really?! <em>(excited)</em>,Ted
15545,Teddy Westside? Continue.,Marshall
15546,"It's the picking, I suck at. I pick the wrong girls. But you guys, you're the best pickers I know. You picked each other.",Ted
15547,Oh well with the slight assist from the Wesleyan housing department.,Lily
15548,And a healthy splash of Drakkar Noir. <em>(they hive five) (Robin giggles)</em>,Marshall
15549,"Get out there and find me a girl. We'll double date on Valentine's Day. If I like her, I will marry her... if she's cool with it. And she will be. Cause I'll wear my nice blazer.",Ted
15550,I love that blazer. Almost as much as Robin loves Don.,Marshall
15551,I do not love Don.,Robin
15552,"Robin, neurologically speaking, the part of the human brain that makes you hate people is located right next to the part of the brain that makes you want to jump people's bones. The two responses are so similar, it's hard to tell them apart.",Marshall
15553,"You know what it's like? Wait, I have to get a book. Give me 30 seconds.",Ted
15554,"OK this is fun. Look at this picture. It's a rabbit! You can look at it for hours and be absolutely sure it's a rabbit. But then one day, you look at it and you realize, &quot;wait a second, it's a duck!&quot; Rabbit, duck, rabbit, duck. Isn't it fun?",Ted
15555,"Relationships are like that. I mean, look, when you first met Don, you hated him, you thought &quot;This guy's a duck&quot;, but one of these days you're gonna realize &quot;This is actually someone that I love, he's a rabbit&quot;.",Marshall
15556,"Wow I think you got it backwards there, buddy. The duck is the thing you love, the rabbit is the thing you hate.",Ted
15557,What?!!,Marshall
15558,"Yeah I got to agree. Duck's up, rabbit down.",Robin
15559,Definitely. Ducks are better than rabbits.,Lily
15560,"I got... ducks are... ducks are... rabbits are adorable. Ducks are aargh. Have you ever been in a fight with a duck? I mean, ducks are... jerks.",Marshall
15561,Duck is delicious. Rabbit is all gamey.,Ted
15562,"<em>(yelling)</em> We're not talking about flavour, Ted.",Marshall
15563,<em>(yelling as well)</em> Flavour counts.,Ted
15564,Who carries a duck's foot for good luck? Anyone?,Marshall
15565,"You wrap yourself in a comforter stuffed with rabbit hair. <em>(almost yells)</em> I wrap myself in one stuffed with duck feathers. Who's cosier? No, no, no, no, no, no... who's cosier?",Robin
15566,"Hold on, I've got to get another book.",Ted
15567,"Then why don't we take, a rabbit, a duck, stick 'em in a cardboard box and let them fight it out?",Ted
15568,"Because it's illegal, Ted!",Marshall
15569,"Only if we bet on it, Marshall!",Ted
15570,FINE! I CAN SEE IT! YOU WIN!,Marshall
15571,Say it.,Robin
15572,You have to say it.,Ted
15573,"Duck's good... <em>(long pause, then whispers...)</em> rabbit's bad.",Marshall

15577,"Thank you. And Don is, and always will be, a rabbit.",Robin

15579,Pants.,Lily

15709,She gave you her hook.,Robin
15710,What? I am not to his hook.,Ted
15711,"Yes, completely.",Barney

15718,I understand.,Marshall
15719,Okay. Wanna see my post of rap?,Marshall
15720,Whore posting!,Lily
15721,So... Lisa Walker gave me false hope for months until one night I went to tell him how much I loved her. In song.,Marshall
15722,"She was not home yet so I waited. And expected. I woke up, covered with snow, after 4h. And then I saw them. The footprints of Lisa. She had passed right by me to the house.",Marshall
15723,It was fine in the end. It freed me from its hook.,Marshall
15724,That's not the same with me and Tiffany. Listen.,Ted
15725,&quot;Right now&quot; is the catch phrase of choice.,Robin
15726,"&quot;For now&quot; you draw a picture of a future where everything will be magical, but in truth, it'll never happen.",Marshall
15727,It's like that. &quot;I can not be with you&quot;. &quot;For now.&quot;,Barney
15728,"I think my high school boyfriend Scooter, is a little to my hook.",Lily
15729,A little? Completely. The poor showed up at our wedding hope you recover.,Marshall
15730,It's weird when I see him at work.,Lily
15731,Wait. What?,Marshall
15732,Scooter works in the Ikea cafeteria 'school. We talked.,Lily
15733,We certainly do not talk about that!,Marshall

15738,You're mounted on it? You did a tour?,Marshall
15739,No!,Lily
15740,Really? In your place I would have rode this scooter all day to break it into two.,Marshall
15741,So these poor women must still walk? Expect. Scooter works in your school?,Marshall
15742,Are you jealous?,Lily
15743,I feel bad for Scooter. It took this job just because he thinks he has a chance with you. You must ensure that he understands that it is wrong for it turns the page and gets a real work canteen. Shit!,Marshall
15744,I tried!,Lily
15745,"Let me be clear, Scooter. There is no way that you and I are together. For now.",Lily
15746,&quot;For now&quot;? You got to the earnest Scooter? You must release your scooter hook.,Marshall

15756,Hold on to it. Never lets go! I have never seen more beautiful girls. They all work with Tiffany?,Barney
15757,Yep.,Ted
15758,"There can be only one explanation for that. Tiffany is a representative... e, pharmaceuticals?",Barney

15760,And you never thought to say?,Barney
15761,What? It's just a job.,Ted
15762,"That a b... Since time immemorial there has always been a professional edge to which girls g*n, like Tiffany, have flocked. I'll redo the story?",Barney
15763,I will not say explicitly.,Ted
15764,"It began 2.5 million years ago. The man was a hunter.So the profession's sexiest moment? Picker. h*m* erectus, indeed. With improved technology, the profession's sexiest moment was changing. I'm sure it's a hernia. You can double-check? And then the man grabbed the heavens. So girls sexy stiletto heels began and became a flight attendant. I'm right and ready to fire. Then the man said, &quot;Life is hard. I should start taking lots of drugs. &quot; So sexy girls landed in medical offices, hot enough to make these pills erection ironically unnecessary. So today, girls are pharma's sexiest moment.",Barney
15765,"Okay. In fact, you've dumped your loser of guy?",Ted
15766,She touched my nose.,Ted
15767,"Largue Tiffany and join the Barnacle in a buffet of girls pharma. There may be loss of clothing, knees b*rned, respiratory weakness and sore abs the next day. That the world give a damn five?!",Barney
15768,"I know you're having trouble dropping Scooter. I decided that you need training. And you say that the problem is his sad eyes? (He returns with a mini pig) Okay, shut up, woman. Now I want you to look this mini pig and you tell him it is impossible for you to be with him one day.",Marshall
15769,"Mini Pig, it is impossible that I may one day with you. For now.",Lily
15770,Go! Be a man!,Marshall
15771,"I'm sorry, but it is just so cute. I just want to cuddle him all day. Oh, yes.",Lily
15772,"You know, it's funny. I remember when you told me stuff like that.",Marshall
15773,I still do.,Lily
15774,Not as much. Not as much.,Marshall
15775,"There's no nights like with pharma pharma because the nights never stop! Dude, I've flirted with three of them. The fantasy. In addition, my cholesterol is low. My restless legs syndrome is cured. I am more alive than ever.",Barney
15776,"Friends, good news. Tiffany broke up with her boyfriend. So I'm not the hook.",Ted
15777,You're always on the hook.,Robin
15778,Look what we did yesterday.,Ted
15779,"First, it was spoiled. Then we shared a chocolate cake.Then, well, I did not used to join the discussions of changing rooms, but I made her a foot massage... rather sensual.",Ted
15780,And let me guess: it's not gone further than that.,Robin
15781,"Well, no, but...",Ted
15782,"And tell me, would you have accidentally made this chocolate cake?",Lily
15783,It was a pre-made.,Ted
15784,There's no shame to admit it. We were all hooked and we all hooked someone.,Lily
15785,I've never done that.,Ted
15786,Are you kidding? And this daughter of the university library? Henrietta?,Robin
15787,Henrietta and I are just friends.,Ted
15788,It is too much to your hook.,Robin
15789,Absolutely not.,Ted
15790,"You like to have Henrietta close for the same reason that Tiffany likes to have you close, it flatters the ego.",Robin
15791,You amaze me that such an expert is to keep people on your hook. And this poor cameraman your job?,Ted
15792,Mike and I are just friends.,Robin
15793,Come on.,Ted
15794,"Yeah, right.",Robin
15795,"If you mean to do my laundry, I'm starting lineup.",Robin
15796,What! I do not keep Mike in my hook.,Robin
15797,You're Captain Hook.,Ted
15798,"Dude, I'm a girl. Our female parts are like a cobweb.Sometimes you jokes of things you want to.",Robin
15799,That's not why it's good.,Ted
15800,"And Henrietta, in any way, are not losing time with you, huh?",Robin
15801,"Henrietta knows we're just friends. In fact, I'll call and get away with it tonight, friends.",Ted
15802,"No, that's fine.",Ted
15803,Hello?,Ted
15804,Hey Tiffany!,Ted
15805,"I would love that. What are you doing here? Great. See you in 10 minutes. Super. Sorry, Henrietta, something unexpected.We redo it, my friend?",Ted
15806,"It works, yeah.",Ted
15807,Champagne?,Ted
15808,"Whatever it is, we can talk now.",Ted
15809,Now that I think a call would have been nice.,Ted
15810,"Come on, Lily. You must drop Scooter. Try it again.",Marshall
15811,Mini pig... I do not wanna be with you. For now.,Lily
15812,Act like a man!,Marshall
15813,Mini pig... I do not wanna be with you. Ever.,Lily
15814,Finish him!,Marshall
15815,It will never be together in any sexual way again.,Lily
15816,Well done. Weird thing to say to a pig.,Marshall
15817,Really bad.,Lily
15818,You know what? That will not work between us... ever. I'm done. (He takes the jacket on the bed and hand) And that's really better for traffic if you weight the arch with your thumbs. Now I'm done.,Ted
15819,I can do it alone.,Lily
15820,So prove it. And... take me a pudding.,Marshall
15821,"Listen, Scooter. There is no way we ever be together.",Lily
15822,Right now! I'm sorry but he is adorable.,Marshall
15823,Listen. I want to be with you.,Lily
15824,So far. Hang in there. I will not be eternal.,Marshall
15825,Yesterday I was with this girl so sexy that pharma should call a doctor if you have no erection for more than 4h. I have no reason people?,Barney
15826,There is no one. Just the girl with whom you came out recently.,Robin
15827,It's over.,Barney
15828,What?,Robin
15829,The girls of pharma are more than g*n. This is the end of an era.,Barney
15830,You're a little dramatic.,Robin
15831,"Really? It starts with a Gladys. And suddenly, a few gay guys not so fabulous fall into the ranks. And before you know it, the girls look like pharma team to a Southwest flight to Albuquerque in Little Rock. It's over!",Barney
15832,I'm done.,Ted
15833,It's worse.,Ted
15834,"Yeah, there was a...",Ted
15835,What did you do?,Robin
15836,"Honestly, I thought to marry him just out of sheer embarrassment. But I did the right thing. I did what anyone who has someone should hook her. I would have broken my heart.",Ted
15837,"Henrietta, I'm sorry if it's brutal but I think you duty. I do not wanna be with you.",Ted
15838,Ever.,Ted
15839,It was violent.,Ted
15840,"Sorry, big guy. Honesty is hard, but ultimately it is the softer alternative. (Mike enters with the laundry basket) I must tell you something. You've finished the laundry fragile?",Robin
15841,It can wait.,Robin
15842,How are you?,Robin
15843,You still broies black to the end of the era of the daughters of pharma?,Ted
15844,I've realized that their reign had to stop to give way to a sexy new profession. It may be... communications officer in an intergalactic spaceship to a distant solar system that we can imagine. Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits.,Barney
15845,Why change your mind?,Robin
15846,"The realization that hope springs eternal. Ca and the little purple pill box found in my bag. I do not know what they are, but they are amazing!",Barney
15847,It all started a week ago.,Barney
15848,I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady.,Barney
15849,Aside from a woman who appreciates a nice tie.,Barney
15850,It was not my best tie.,Barney
15851,"So, right after that, I took her home.",Barney
15852,"Fortunately, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow.",Barney
15853,"What? Wait, what? I thought your body would become a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger only to satisfy my every carnal desires.",Barney
15854,I really think Don and I found our rhythm to work.,Robin
15855,The answer might surprise you. It's all rodents.,Robin
15856,Nice to meet you.,Marshall
15857,"This guy is awesome. It's funny, smart, beautiful. You have him to nab it before someone else.",Marshall
15858,I hope you do not talk to you.,Robin
15859,It's been 4 months since you broke up with Barney. It's time to get back on the market.,Lily
15860,"Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier.",Marshall
15861,"I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners.",Barney
15862,"It looks like she has read this book, Of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail. What? It was this book that helps girls find a husband. It is that of Robin. I just laminated. Okay! Barney, when you were with this girl, she subtly used the word &quot;sex&quot;?",Ted
15863,Continuous. Continues.,Barney
15864,Did she used an excuse for physical contact?,Ted
15865,Kashmir? This is the virgin merino hand-woven. The fibers of this costume are spaced less than 12 microns.,Barney
15866,"Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle.",Barney
15867,She did it too!,Barney
15868,"And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, &quot;I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week? &quot;",Ted
15869,"You try this shit of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail.",Barney
15870,Did you just say you got a kid!,Barney
15871,Completely.,Barney
15872,Of course. Well...,Barney
15873,Just tell me how!,Barney
15874,"Excuse me, someone is using this stool?",Barney
15875,That is: no sex before hot date 17th.,Ted
15876,"If you're not going to take her 17th hot date, you should give up.",Lily
15877,"I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted...",Barney
15878,From Robin is Robin.,Ted
15879,I can have two shots ahead. There is a flaw in there and I will get it.,Barney
15880,Saturday night?,Robin
15881,It invites you to come out? Say yes! Say yes!,Marshall
15882,"Don... Listen, it's... it's really nice of you, and you're really great...",Robin
15883,"I just have a cold. That's why for my voice. (She goes into the kitchen and tries to pick up the phone) But great for Saturday night. One can go to a restaurant grill, and you could bring a first side for my friends Marshall. I gotta go. Kisses.",Marshall
15884,But what are you doing?,Robin
15885,"You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you.",Marshall
15886,I can not believe. Friends... This is it! She wrote the book! It must be named Anita. My plan was to sleep with her but it changes everything. New plan: I'll sleep with her.,Barney
15887,"That girl that Barney hunting, it seems a somewhat anti-Barney. I like the way the universe has decided to collect.",Lily
15888,"Actually, Anita Barney went to see him because I have requested.",Robin
15889,You told to go and see Anita Barney? How you know her?,Lily
15890,It was my show.,Robin
15891,"But, uh... if you had to summarize your book in less than 30 words...",Robin
15892,"Is not this the dream of all women? After the break, we'll talk about your new book, Of course you have not yet retirement plan, look at you, poor trail, scheduled for June We come back after the break.",Robin
15893,"Absolutely, Mike, great idea.",Robin
15894,I have not really want right now.,Robin
15895,"And then I told him everything. It came out at once. And in the end, she said...",Robin
15896,That's to say?,Robin
15897,"Come on, it does not really work, though?",Robin
15898,"I never thought that I would think, but... I thought about it.",Robin
15899,"This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger. (Robin phone) I put on the StairMaster and...",Barney
15900,It does.,Robin
15901,"Spoilers. Regardless, we did.",Barney
15902,"I know it was stupid, but, see, at that time, I was still depressed over the break. I was in my phase of mourning. It means a lot of tape and long nights at the sh**ting range.",Robin
15903,I hope this was not the same nights.,Lily
15904,"Serious, Lily. I do not remember everything.",Robin
15905,You knew that Robin was in mourning? It looked good after the break.,Marshall
15906,"You know her. She keeps her emotions for her. But yes, I saw her crying sometimes.",Lily
15907,She cried? Real tears? It means...,Marshall
15908,"Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier. You see, this guy has been very active. Sexually. Finally, it is like that... bang... bang... bang... You see? It's like... bang... bang...",Marshall
15909,How could you let me do? You're my wife. You must avoid that I ridiculed in public.,Marshall
15910,"I know, but the song is rather catchy.",Lily
15911,Shit. I read this entire book and I find no fault. What will I do?,Barney
15912,There is another option... but you're not ready.,Ted
15913,Tell me.,Barney
15914,"If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date.",Ted
15915,A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?,Barney
15916,"If you want my help, it's a super hot date.",Ted
15917,Okay.,Barney
15918,Let me do it. I will plan everything.,Ted
15919,You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic?,Barney
15920,Cutesy and romantic? (He starts singing) No need to take him to Paris or Peru...,Ted
15921,What are you doing?,Barney
15922,They look at us.,Barney
15923,How important it is for you...,Ted
15924,Really? You really gonna do that?,Barney
15925,It looks to me like cutesy and romantic. Box strip?,Barney
15926,Box strip.,Ted
15927,Tonight is the big night. Where do you take D-Bag?This is a bad nickname for Don. I will look better.,Marshall
15928,I just... I canceled.,Robin
15929,How does it... Wait.,Marshall
15930,A problem?,Lily
15931,Robin canceled his hot date.,Marshall
15932,What? She was super excited there is one hour.,Ted
15933,You look like the classiest and most expensive of all prostitutes.,Ted
15934,Thank you.,Robin
15935,You're excited to go out with Don?,Ted
15936,You know what? Looks good. Do not tell Marshall.,Robin
15937,"I will say nothing. I bet you will spend a good evening. And not, however, a great night. A great night will be spent by Barney during his date with Anita. A carriage ride, dinner at &quot;Tombeur panties.&quot; They call it a super hot date.",Ted
15938,Ted! How could you do that?! Robin has just released his period of mourning!,Marshall
15939,She seemed happy after the break.,Ted
15940,You see nothing. Typical of a guy. She was obviously devastated.,Marshall
15941,"Wait, but that would mean...",Ted
15942,You sing what?,Ted
15943,A song about the number of girls that Barney has typed recently.,Marshall
15944,I'll sing a verse.,Ted
15945,Super.,Marshall
15946,Where is she?,Ted
15947,I think it is the toilet.,Marshall
15948,"I'm fine, I'm fine.",Robin
15949,Why did you do that?,Barney
15950,"Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire.",Marshall
15951,Why are you angry against me?,Barney
15952,You were a real assh*le to Robin when she was in her period of mourning.,Ted
15953,The period of mourning? She has not had a period of mourning.,Barney
15954,You see nothing.,Ted
15955,Typical of a guy.,Marshall
15956,"Barney, sit down, there are two three things to tell you.",Lily
15957,"What, she is upset?",Barney
15958,"Of course she is upset. Look at you, poor trail.",Lily
15959,You should have seen.,Barney
15960,I'm going.,Robin
15961,We go back home...,Barney
15962,I can not believe that Robin is upset.,Barney
15963,And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet.,Marshall
15964,I did worse after the premiere of &quot;The Phantom Menace.&quot;It's been like that since we broke up?,Barney
15965,"Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where.",Lily
15966,I know where.,Barney
15967,"Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date.",Robin
15968,I know you're upset.,Barney
15969,"What? No. I've never been happier. Anita and this seems great. I'm so glad... by the merest chance, you found yourself. It warms my f*cking heart.",Robin
15970,You sure you're not upset?,Barney
15971,Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you?,Robin
15972,You're not another number for me.,Barney
15973,"And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks.",Robin
15974,"I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven?",Barney
15975,"Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you.",Robin
15976,"Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want.",Barney
15977,Do not sleep with Anita.,Robin
15978,I promise.,Barney
15979,Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not?,Robin
15980,It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go.,Barney
15981,I wanted to call you.,Barney
15982,"I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no.",Barney
15983,No.,Barney
15984,No.,Barney
15985,No.,Barney
15986,No.,Barney
15987,No.,Barney
15988,Yeah.,Ted
15989,I'm sorry. The answer is no.,Barney
15990,Here is my story.,Barney
15991,I hope so too.,Barney
15992,This is an old story of married women.,Ted
15993,How was this date?,Marshall
15994,Good enough. Pretty... pretty good.,Robin
15995,How so?,Ted
15996,"Come on, guys. It was good. It was nice. We spent a pleasant evening. Let... Let him that. Even if...",Robin
15997,It's my birthday!,Lily
15998,It's still my birthday!,Lily
15999,"Feliz cumpleanos, baby. The theme of this breakfast in bed is... &quot;Spanish Interlude.&quot; (A musician enters the room and opens the curtain Marshall) How have we landed on the lyric rolling hills of northern Spain? Baby, it will be huge tonight. We five, dinner well dressed, and Ted brings your cognac cheesecake Pumpkin at Edgar. I'll go shopping super secret birthday. And I took him because I do not like the way he looks at you.",Marshall
16000,"A new camera! Thank you, Marshall. I love it!",Lily
16001,"Small bonus, I took pictures of me naked before packing. With a node.",Marshall
16002,There was not a knot.,Lily
16003,On the other device.,Marshall
16004,Thank you. I will make great photos of our group with that.,Lily
16005,I want the perfect group sh*t. Marshall put yourself between Robin and Barney.,Lily
16006,Why?,Barney
16007,"You know... Light, color, balance, aperture...",Lily
16008,"You say stuff pictures. Expect. You do not want it to look like a couple, right?",Robin
16009,Of course. You will not last! The photo is forever.,Lily
16010,How dare you?,Barney
16011,It's so rude.,Robin
16012,It's true.,Barney
16013,"Totally. It is a tightrope, but still.",Robin
16014,"Okay, I am perhaps a little bossy, but I want to remember it all. Like tonight. I imagine no better birthday being with my 4 best friends only. (A knock at the door) And Ted's here.",Lily
16015,Happy Birthday! Here is Amanda.,Ted
16016,And Amanda...,Lily
16017,"Ted, you had to bring a cheesecake, but you've brought two shopping bags and a girl who knows not. My name is Marshall. Welcome. Ted talks.",Marshall
16018,"Amanda will make a cake for Lily. She is head. We met at the restaurant last week when I returned my soup. Fortunately, she has such beautiful hair it not bother me a bit to eat.",Ted
16019,I'm really happy you make me my cake.,Lily
16020,"In honor of the 32nd anniversary of Lily, I expected a lot of great games, beginning with... &quot;Lil-ial Pursuit.&quot; Who has the number 1?",Marshall
16021,"Sure. Okay, this is Amanda begins. You have 32 seconds to answer a ton of questions. And... Here we go. Lily's favorite color?",Marshall
16022,It's Robin.,Marshall
16023,I think Ted whispered the word &quot;yellow&quot;. It is equally untrue. (Later...) This game is called... raising the cost of perfection.,Marshall
16024,Pretty.,Lily
16025,"Thank you. You wrote all that you love our queen of the day. And Lilypad, you must guess who wrote what. &quot;From his friends to his students, Lily that everyone in his life...&quot;",Marshall
16026,Lily is a teacher. Hence the &quot;students&quot;.,Ted
16027,"&quot;... feel loved. She makes the best cookies oatmeal raisin-, The Goonies knows by heart... &quot;",Marshall
16028,"Lily saw The Goonies just after his parents separated. After that, she had real problems of trust.",Ted
16029,"&quot;And that's the strongest person I know. I can not imagine my life without her. I love you, Lily.",Marshall
16030,Of course it was me.,Robin
16031,Come here.,Lily
16032,"Too cute. Lily, guess who wrote it. &quot;You look really nice.&quot;",Marshall
16033,I would say Amanda.,Lily
16034,"No, it was me. And I meant it.",Barney
16035,"Tell me if you need help. (Amanda from the kitchen) Quick, group photo! All front of the fireplace.",Lily
16036,"Wait, I'll find Amanda.",Ted
16037,"No problem, it is occupied. The bother, come on.",Lily
16038,"Wait... You do not want Amanda on the picture, right?",Ted
16039,"Well, you know, auto focus, speed of obstruction, zoom...",Lily
16040,"Lily, what's the matter?",Ted
16041,Who wants a party hat? I'm a bird! All do the bird!,Marshall
16042,Tell me the truth.,Ted
16043,Of course not. I let another of your bitches spoil my memories.,Lily
16044,"Lily, what are you talking?",Ted
16045,"Ted, you always do that. You bring a girl knows that not all our evenings with us.",Lily
16046,That's not true.,Ted
16047,"Really? So, let us walk bitch Street Shuffle.",Lily
16048,Or we could continue the descent on the Avenue Best Birthday.,Marshall
16049,I Can Vote? Street bitch! Street bitch!,Barney
16050,"My friends, I made a song for tonight. Follow me, the chorus is this: Merry, Merry Lily-anniversary...",Marshall
16051,"Christmas morning, there was 4. Our first Christmas together, just us five. Here's another nice little game. It's called, Appoints This Bitch.",Lily
16052,That's Pap Pa......,Ted
16053,"False. You think the Santa Claus, because it was Christmas.",Lily
16054,Funny. Every year my mother took tea with her friend Easter Bell. Not so funny.,Robin
16055,"I remember, this is Sarah.",Ted
16056,"Almost. This is Leilani. She had to come at Christmas because, you said, &quot;Folks, this may be good.&quot; And this is not the only &quot;maybe good&quot;.

16058,Thank you. You believe not just enter. Look! Look! Why not look at you! This is Slash from g*n N'Roses!,Barney
16059,Group Photo!,Lily
16060,"And we have had. We had a group photo with Slash on my birthday. Great, huh? Eh?",Barney
16061,"It was there, we know the end.",Robin
16062,False!,Barney
16063,The funny for this photo. I plottait ass.,Robin
16064,Oh? So do I.,Lily
16065,And me too. He has how many hands?,Barney
16066,Normal if it is good guitarist.,Ted
16067,"Actually, sorry, man. I had you taken to Lily.",Marshall
16068,Wait. Look at these pictures. Barney always has the same pose and all these years.,Robin
16069,"Yes, at this point, I have never an old head on the photos. Neither ever or always.",Barney
16070,It's gotta be a lousy picture of you.,Robin
16071,"Nope, not at all.",Barney
16072,And in elementary school? We all have school pictures ugly.,Robin
16073,"Not the Barnacle. I always look awesome mortally. Not like Marshall, who seems to be ingeniously death.",Barney
16074,They are not all bad. Like... this. Look. I have my eyes open.,Marshall
16075,You really put a knot!,Barney
16076,"A crisp, Barney?",Robin
16077,Of course.,Barney
16078,I! A photo ugly.,Robin
16079,You sure?,Barney
16080,No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips?,Robin
16081,It's physically impossible for me to take a picture ugly. I know why. Ask God.,Barney
16082,"Lily, sorry for Amanda. But I'll say. You make your spoiled rotten. You in all your statements because you think I messed up two three photos?",Ted
16083,"These girls have ruined so many things, or you forget Paris.",Lily
16084,This is what happened in Paris?,Robin
16085,"In the first year of college, I studied in Paris, and I had not seen Marshall since 2 months.",Lily
16086,2 months. And I just started making love. I was not ready to stop for 2 months.,Marshall
16087,"And Marshall came to me to spring break. And at the last minute, Ted decided to go with the girl he had just to get back, Karen.",Lily
16088,I'm so excited you're here.,Ted
16089,I'm so excited to remake love.,Marshall
16090,But just before takeoff...,Lily
16091,Really? Because I think I want to tell you the same thing.,Ted
16092,And so began the longest 7:30 of Marshall's life. When I went to look for...,Lily
16093,2 months! My balls were blue! Blue!,Marshall
16094,"It will not surprise you, but the rest of the trip was horrible. I did a picture of a romantic kiss in front of the Eiffel Tower, I actually had. It was just between Karen and Francis, our server yesterday.",Lily
16095,"It's terrible. My laptop is just... fell. You me collected?(Barney looks to pick it up) Mouse, f*ck! I!",Robin
16096,You sure?,Barney
16097,Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing!,Robin
16098,"The camera loves me. Much more than that. The device I want. The unit wants to put on underwear, put an Al Green CD, dim the lights and do all the work while I was still lying with closed eyes.",Barney
16099,"I feel sorry for Paris and group photos ruined, but... when you're single, you must hope that every girl is good. I mean, Erin.Irene.",Ted
16100,Emily. Isabelle.,Lily
16101,And Sarah.,Ted
16102,Leilani! What's your problem?,Lily
16103,"At the time, I thought each of these girls could be good, but I have to keep hoping. I have no choice.",Ted
16104,"Here is another. More random bitch to my birthday! Hey, baby!",Lily
16105,The drawer under the oven. I can not wait. You're the best!,Lily
16106,"I'm sorry, Ted. I agree with Lily on this. This kind of evening is hard for someone new. That's why I have not brought Don. When I was in Japan, this guy, hot date for our third, took me to his brother's wedding. Now I, a complete stranger, am on the photo album of the marriage of a Japanese couple forever.",Robin
16107,You should listen to Robin.,Lily
16108,Because Robin is your best friend.,Ted
16109,Right.,Lily
16110,Your best friend on Earth.,Ted
16111,Absolutely.,Lily
16112,Attention Lily. It's a trap.,Marshall
16113,"Before being your best friend, what was she? That's it. One of my random sluts.",Ted
16114,"Yes, okay, Ted. This bitch has proved some nice, but except for bitches, not the rule of bitches.",Lily
16115,I'm starting to cry.,Robin
16116,"It puts an end to all this conversation about the bitches.Back to the birthday song! Barney, your part is this: &quot;She's cute She's cute.&quot;",Marshall
16117,I bring these girls to party because you are important. You are my family.,Ted
16118,Yes. We are a family. So why these parties can not they be us?,Lily
16119,Like the time we celebrated the success of Marshall to the bar.,Lily
16120,Here's the disgusting smelly hippie with whom I go out.,Ted
16121,I did not say that!,Ted
16122,It's as if you had done.,Lily
16123,Here's Framboise.,Ted
16124,You must order more food?,Marshall
16125,No. Raspberry does not eat.,Ted
16126,"Let us raise our glasses. During the last 3 years, Marshall has worked so hard, and I am so proud of you.",Lily
16127,I confess. Raspberry was a mistake. But how would I know?,Ted
16128,"If this is so important, Amanda is not in the picture. It does not spoil your birthday. Give him a chance.",Ted
16129,"Look. We're all friends again! Now working on the harmonies. Merry, Merry Lily-versary! Merry, Merry Lily-versary!",Marshall
16130,"&quot;Happy 42nd Birthday, Lori.&quot;",Lily
16131,"&quot;42nd&quot;? Does the f*cking b*mb appeared to have 42 years? Or worse, she has a mind to call Lori?!",Marshall
16132,"No, Marshall, it does not matter.",Lily
16133,If Lily is serious. Get out of this stranger in my house!,Marshall
16134,Out!,Marshall
16135,"Amanda refuses to return. She thinks you hate it. Marshall, you have to go apologize.",Ted
16136,"You've ruined Lily's birthday and you want me to apologize? At worst, you should apologize.",Marshall
16137,What are you talking?,Ted
16138,"You bring her girls at our parties, and it lets them believe that things are serious. After the largues when you, you know to whom they turn? Me. I was the cleaning crew of your girlfriends for years.",Marshall
16139,"I had just returned from a marathon to study the law library. Hi, Natalie, where is Ted?",Marshall
16140,You know what? I have not slept for 36 hours. Just a few minutes.,Marshall
16141,"And at first I was totally sympathetic. But damn, Ted, over the years, you made me cynical.",Marshall
16142,"I'll get us something to eat, and we'll talk about it until it is clear.",Marshall
16143,"Me too. Yeah. But you know, life goes darling.",Marshall
16144,Shut up.,Marshall
16145,"Sorry that my search for love has you so upset. You know, your precious photos might be better if I was not over.",Ted
16146,They would be if Marshall was not on it.,Barney
16147,Cheap sh*t. Low blow.,Marshall
16148,You know what these pictures? A big lie. We ask. They are retouched. They are what you want but not the reality.,Ted
16149,This is not true!,Lily
16150,"Oh? Look at that one. Halloween, there is 2 years old. You had not played because you wanted to disguise yourself as a penguin.",Ted
16151,"It's not that she would not, but she said that penguins are zero. Penguins.",Marshall
16152,"And yet you're there, smiling as if nothing was wrong, completely wrong. Robin's birthday, there is 3 years old. Robin had a cold, and you made him remove his pajamas for the photo.",Ted
16153,And you got me pinched cheeks very hard for them to be pink.,Robin
16154,"Yeah, but you were beautiful.",Lily
16155,And then we all ate chocolate cake in my bed.,Robin
16156,"Actually, it was a good evening.",Marshall
16157,It's true.,Lily
16158,"Yeah, that was good.",Ted
16159,Look at that one. This is the first picture of us three.,Lily
16160,It's true.,Marshall
16161,Do you remember what happened?,Ted
16162,"Wait, we take what poses? The two cops friends?",Ted
16163,No! Why not sitcom of the 80s with two roommates who never agree?,Marshall
16164,"Hi, Marshall. Ready for the film?",Lily
16165,Yeah. Just one second per cons. We are writing history. We'll take our first picture of roommate.,Marshall
16166,And if you came to ask us?,Ted
16167,Really?,Lily
16168,Yeah.,Ted
16169,"What are you doing, Ted? And if one breaks?",Marshall
16170,And if you break it?,Ted
16171,Come.,Marshall
16172,I had totally forgotten that. Marshall and I were together for only a few weeks and you invited me in the photo.,Lily
16173,I liked you.,Ted
16174,We must bring back Amanda.,Lily
16175,Really?,Ted
16176,"You believed in me. It's my turn to believe in you. As far as I know, this is good.",Lily
16177,"Thank you, Lil.",Ted
16178,I think Lori's age made him very wise.,Robin
16179,It is said that it was after 40 years we know each other really.,Barney
16180,"Come on everybody, come here. Let's make a memory.",Lily
16181,"Marshall, try this. Keep your eyes closed until the last second and when I say, open them.",Ted
16182,It's a hole in your jacket?,Robin
16183,What? Where?,Barney
16184,"Now, Marshall!",Ted
16185,Shit!,Robin
16186,Names that bitch.,Lily
16187,Ann has...? Anna?,Ted
16188,"No, it was my birthday.",Lily
16189,Your brain is too predictable associations.,Marshall
16190,"Come on, everybody. Come here. Let's make a memory.",Lily
16191,Is there anything in the sauce that you've made? It tastes like... coriander. And... you know that cilantro makes me...,Barney
16192,Yes!,Robin
16193,I love traveling.,Barney
16194,"Hawaii is fun. A buddy of mine lives in Seattle. It's really not bad. But the best place? I must say, the moon.",Barney
16195,You're not convinced a girl that you were the first to walk on the moon? It was seven years before you were born.,Ted
16196,"Ted, a blonde, it's easy.",Barney
16197,"Our ship is passed through a hole spatiotemporal or gamma rays or something. I started to rejuvenate, blah, blah, blah. So you bump into one store yoghurt. It must be insane.",Barney
16198,"But I worked at a yogurt shop in high school. And indeed, it was... insane.",Marshall
16199,"So, after 20 minutes, the eagle has landed. We fuse into space. Houston, we have a complainer. Other double entender related to space.",Barney
16200,Why are you lying all the time?,Ted
16201,"I do not lie! We made love, I have pictures!",Barney
16202,I hate my job.,Robin
16203,What? You had not interviewed the mayor?,Marshall
16204,"Mayor McWouaf. It teaches the children clean, dressed dog. Finally, it is supposed to.",Robin
16205,The table! There was a table... Back. (The cameraman has fun throwing papers) were returned.,Robin
16206,"Yeah, I understand.",Robin
16207,"A single interview proper, it would be nice for a change.",Robin
16208,"Okay, I look at my calendar, see when I'm available. But I want a list of questions in advance and nothing about my private life.",Ted
16209,"Ted, you've nabbed seven peanuts in a row. Impressive but not enough to be published.",Robin
16210,You have nabbed seven in a row?,Marshall
16211,seven in a row. But I speak not of it. I talk about my selection for the construction of a scale model of the Empire State Building for the greater recovery of the New York skyline in the world.,Ted
16212,That's the thing with which you played the other day?,Robin
16213,I was playing it. I was working.,Ted
16214,&quot;It's you. &quot;&quot; It's me. &quot;&quot; I saw you in the street. &quot;&quot; Are you Annie? &quot;&quot; Yes. &quot;,Ted
16215,How long are you here?,Ted
16216,Ten seconds.,Robin
16217,"Yeah, just the end.",Ted
16218,Again?,Marshall
16219,"This is the pizza. Baby, you got the cash?",Lily
16220,"You know, in fact, it was not me who should pay.Because I do not really like pizza.",Marshall
16221,What!?,Lily
16222,It was literally across the country a hundred times for a pizza.,Ted
16223,I even caught a pizza in the shower.,Lily
16224,"I'm not saying he loves pizza, but the last time he went, the doctor said, &quot;stop eating pizza. &quot;Marshall:&quot; Why? &quot;Doc:&quot; To you examine. &quot; But seriously, we laugh because we love you.",Barney
16225,"Okay, so I have no money on me... it's because... I was as*ault.",Marshall
16226,You...?,Lily
16227,What?,Ted
16228,"You can pay Arthur? I have the slab! How is your father, anyway?",Marshall
16229,That's good.,Marshall
16230,Did you get mugged?,Lily
16231,Who? He wore a black hat and beard of the day? He said &quot;Hands up! &quot;?,Barney
16232,"Yes, because I was as*ault in 1947 at the corner of Abbott and Costello. But no. I cut through Central Park back from work.",Marshall
16233,It's good. It's good.,Marshall
16234,It was downright terrifying.,Marshall
16235,It was downright terrifying.,Barney
16236,What are you doing?,Marshall
16237,I repeat. I will say that it happened to me to lie on compassion.,Barney
16238,It will not work. If?,Marshall
16239,Not a bit.,Lily
16240,I authorize you to do.,Marshall
16241,"I do not think there's a g*n to my Marshmallow. Now, I tremble. I think I will not sleep all night.",Lily
16242,"Oh, sweetie. I have a trick to help you sleep. (She pulls out his g*n) Glue this under your pillow. You'll sleep like a f*cking baby.",Robin
16243,Robin puts it.,Ted
16244,It's going to hurt someone. There is the... security.,Robin
16245,"Okay, you know what? We'll all calm down. We do not need a g*n. I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life.",Marshall
16246,I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life. It's great. But I think I'll add a tear.,Barney
16247,"Listen baby, I know it's scary, but look at me. I'm fine.You can put this behind us?",Marshall
16248,It's gold! But I'd rather say 'put me behind you. &quot;,Barney
16249,"Baby, do not worry for me, I mean, yes, I'm a little scared, but I am New York. I will not let me change it.",Lily
16250,I changed! I like the w*apon now. Charger.,Lily
16251,Maybe there should be a pause..,Robin
16252,"I said, &quot;shipper&quot;.",Lily
16253,You wanna buy a g*n?,Marshall
16254,"No one who scares. A tiny Beretta pink that goes with these cute sandals I just bought. In fact, our new credit card works.",Lily
16255,"You do not need a w*apon. All studies in the world come together to say that a home is safer with no w*apon, especially ours. You know how I ever hurt you unintentionally.",Marshall
16256,"Pretty easy, huh? (And send the cork in the eye of Lily. Marshall and Lily sleeping when Marshall is a slap to Lily. Marshall before the fridge and opens the door when Lily arrives. They dance loose Lily and Marshall) Dispatch, baby. The party will begin. (Lily is dressed up and scared a k*ll Marshall puts his fist) You had to disguise yourself in sexy chat!",Marshall
16257,I have changed my mind.,Lily
16258,"Now, you want to add a w*apon in this equation?",Marshall
16259,"I know, you're right, but every time I close my eyes, I see this guy pointing a g*n at you. And... you're my world, Marshall. If something happened to you one day, I would...",Lily
16260,"I know. I know. Listen, I must confess something. This attack did not go exactly as I said.",Marshall
16261,So it was indeed a black bonnet. J'l'avais said!,Barney
16262,He wore no black cap. It is wearing nothing at all.,Marshall
16263,"Wait, so...",Ted
16264,It's good. It's good.,Marshall
16265,He as*ault you naked?,Lily
16266,I do not ask where he kept his w*apon.,Barney
16267,We're sure it was a w*apon?,Ted
16268,"No, guys. I came home from work on foot. Through Central Park, and I stopped at the zoo.",Marshall
16269,It's good. It's good.,Marshall
16270,You're telling us...,Barney
16271,What you got mugged...,Ted
16272,For a monkey. I got mugged by a monkey.,Marshall
16273,You've been mugged by a monkey?,Barney
16274,"Yeah, I got mugged by a monkey. I was embarrassed, so I invented another story. The important, Lily, you do not need a w*apon.",Marshall
16275,Forget the w*apon. It is on that now.,Lily
16276,The monkeys attack people? It really is a jungle out.,Ted
16277,This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a gang?I hope he will climb to see us.,Lily
16278,Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet?,Barney
16279,Because I saw that the monkey did and I wanted more after.,Marshall
16280,New information has been discovered on the attack on Marshall.,Barney
16281,Really? They caught him?,Robin
16282,He is behind bars.,Ted
16283,"So, where did they find?",Robin
16284,"I think naked in a tree, throwing his feces.",Lily
16285,I've seen. That's why I take the taxi.,Robin
16286,"You know how they caught him, huh?",Ted
16287,They tracked.,Marshall
16288,They tracked!,Ted
16289,What's happening?,Robin
16290,Okay. That's what happened.,Marshall
16291,"No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana...",Barney
16292,"I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well.",Marshall
16293,You're right. The banana was on the floor.,Barney
16294,Was not... Was not banana banana.,Marshall
16295,"Marshall, I'm sorry, really. Here's what happened.",Barney
16296,Do not sh**t. There was no banana!,Marshall
16297,"Come on, Barney. I know that Marshall has not been mugged by a monkey.",Robin
16298,"This part is right. It is not unusual, right? Thailand, China, Costa Rica, people are attacked by monkeys all the time.They are gatherers. Because of their dynamic inter-social, have a predisposition to flight, gives them a genetic advantage.",Marshall
16299,You've been mugged by a monkey!,Lily
16300,It might be curious. You were wearing a yellow hat?,Ted
16301,What? Him in your program? And my model?,Ted
16302,No one wants to see a guy who comes to play with dolls.,Robin
16303,"First, it was not what you think. Secondly, you got a guy playing with dolls.",Ted
16304,"So, your dolls are favorites of Rhinebeck prices next month.",Robin
16305,And you invited back for a second interview.,Ted
16306,"Because the FBI wanted to be occupied while they searched his home. Come on, Marshall. I need history. It has everything. Crime, monkeys, no stupid model of the Empire State Building, which takes me all my living room and smelly glue everywhere. Go. Do this for me... As a friend?",Robin
16307,It would be nice to see you on TV.,Lily
16308,Can you promise me to present it so that I am not ridiculous to myself as*ault by a monkey?,Marshall
16309,You've been mugged by a monkey.,Lily
16310,I've just been mugged.,Barney
16311,What?,Ted
16312,That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now...,Barney
16313,It was downright terrifying. I would just like to forget what happened and continue to live my life.,Barney
16314,"Well, my name is not Neil. This is Bar...",Barney
16315,"Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?",Barney
16316,And it was the best thing in my life 3.,Barney
16317,"Funny, you look like you just got two vodka and tonic in the face.",Ted
16318,You're the lemon in your hair.,Marshall
16319,"The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts...",Barney
16320,Really? Cool.,Marshall
16321,Who knows someone who has been mugged by a monkey?,Robin
16322,"Nobody except the good people of Thailand, China, Costa Rica and many other countries where the crime committed by the monkeys is a common nuisance.",Marshall
16323,"The best is that it is possible that the story goes on national TV. Guys, this story of the monkey attacker can make me famous.",Robin
16324,"Me too. Guys, it will not. I can not do that.",Marshall
16325,It's a little embarrassing. So what?,Ted
16326,That's not it. Guys... I'm not as*ault by a monkey.,Marshall
16327,"So, you've not been mugged by a monkey?",Ted
16328,Not at all.,Marshall
16329,So what you're saying is that you got the monkey trapped so you give him your wallet?,Barney
16330,"No, that's not it.",Marshall
16331,So you got the monkey attacked?,Ted
16332,"Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a g*n.",Marshall
16333,"You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat?",Barney
16334,That would be the right size.,Ted
16335,"I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a w*apon. In truth, it never happened.",Marshall
16336,I can not believe.,Barney
16337,What?,Marshall
16338,You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous.,Barney
16339,I would not?,Marshall
16340,"If serious, this is too funny.",Barney
16341,"Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends.",Marshall
16342,"I, yes, but still.",Barney
16343,But I can not lie on national TV.,Marshall
16344,You know a long time. He told the truth?,Barney
16345,"Ted, do not do that...",Marshall
16346,I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.,Ted
16347,I still say that it happened.,Barney
16348,"Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.",Ted
16349,"Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body.",Barney
16350,"It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them.",Ted
16351,"False! They like to discover that they lied. &quot;Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth.&quot; Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!",Barney
16352,You mean what you done to him.,Marshall
16353,"No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said.",Barney
16354,"Passed. Who wants to do something to 3? (The two women throw their glasses to him the figure) Lisa, wait.",Barney
16355,"It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied.",Barney
16356,"31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world!",Barney
16357,You know it.,Barney
16358,Well done! I have too much sleep last night. Can you imagine that I almost buy a g*n? I'm glad you as*ault by a monkey.,Lily
16359,You got me. I was just nervous. I got mugged by a monkey.,Marshall
16360,Yeah! I knew it.,Barney
16361,Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.,Ted
16362,"Come on, Ted. Why he would invent something like that?",Barney
16363,"Come on, Ted.",Marshall
16364,"Come here. Seriously, what's your flavor? It's intoxicating.",Ted
16365,"Do not be nervous. We will sit down... It's that thing, whore?",Robin
16366,"I know. Looks like something covered by a sheet. If you want to discover, you will have to do a story on it.",Ted
16367,It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid.,Robin
16368,"Dude, what do you do?",Barney
16369,"I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.",Ted
16370,Now I want a w*apon.,Barney
16371,The monkey is there.,Marshall
16372,Surprise. We thought it would help to bring you to confront your abuser.,Robin
16373,I bet he will love it.,Lily
16374,The name of his companion is Milly?,Marshall
16375,"In your own words, describe what happened.",Robin
16376,"Well... I'd love to tell you what happened, Robin. But... I really want to know what's under that sheet.",Marshall
16377,We talk about that. We speak your aggression.,Robin
16378,"People are attacked every day in New York, Robin, do we often see what's under that sheet? You can sh**t it?",Marshall
16379,We come back.,Robin
16380,What are you doing?,Robin
16381,I have not really been attacked by a monkey. I invented it for that Lily buys a g*n.,Marshall
16382,You have not been attacked by a monkey?,Lily
16383,"What are you talking, baby? Of course I do.",Marshall
16384,"Great, tell it to America. Five minutes.",Robin
16385,Not five minutes. I have not been attacked by a monkey.,Marshall
16386,It's good. I buy a g*n.,Lily
16387,No. I got mugged.,Marshall
16388,No! I have not been mugged!,Marshall
16389,You know if it was attacked?,Barney
16390,I have no idea.,Ted
16391,Tell us just what happened.,Lily
16392,"Yes, tell us the truth.",Robin
16393,Okay! That is the truth. I go back... back to bed.,Marshall
16394,"Shit. Okay, put a microphone.",Robin
16395,Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.,Ted
16396,It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good.,Barney
16397,"Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you.",Ted
16398,"Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way.",Barney
16399,I doubt it.,Ted
16400,It's really happening?,Ted
16401,"Of course, Ted.",Barney
16402,Please do not.,Ted
16403,"Please, stop.",Ted
16404,"Mom, mom, it's good. You're not obliged to ask you with him. There's full of guys...",Ted
16405,"Yeah! Finally, I... I'm glad you're happy.",Ted
16406,"Oh, congratulations!",Lily
16407,We're so happy for you!,Marshall
16408,"I love to listen to you, Mom.",Ted
16409,Best...,Robin
16410,... marriage...,Marshall
16411,... never...,Lily
16412,... seen.,Barney
16413,Oh my God.,Ted
16414,"Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.",Barney
16415,You're currently whining?,Barney
16416,"I know it's stupid, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?",Robin
16417,"Not as much as me, Robin. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.",Barney
16418,"And then I just tell you guys what Robin has done, but you were there for. I must tell you the rest of the wedding. Aunt Meredith!",Barney
16419,"Robin whining during the song Clint. Oh, I've already said. The super good sister of Ted, Heather!",Barney
16420,I gotta go.,Ted
16421,"Wait, Ted. And your speech?",Marshall
16422,Inventing an emergency or anything. I... I... I'll get it.,Ted
16423,"Ted, Ted, what are you doing? It is the marriage of your mother!",Marshall
16424,"Uncle Larry, sky gods. Niagara Falls. It is empty.",Barney
16425,"Seriously, Ted is fine? I mean, I know that the weekend was hard, but hey... it's weird radio silence.",Lily
16426,I know. His mother called such five times to ask where he was.,Robin
16427,Sorry Robin. They are all out of pretzels. And I know how you're emotional. (He gives her a stack of paper towels) Shh. Leave it alone.,Barney
16428,"Okay! Okay, I... I cried during the song Clint.",Robin
16429,She cried to the song of Clint.,Barney
16430,"Hi, guys.",Ted
16431,"Ted, where were you?",Lily
16432,Is that okay?,Robin
16433,"Oh, that's fine. I'm in top form. Go. We'll take a look!",Ted
16434,"Hey, man, you would not possibly let someone who does not like a kind of mania old driving license?",Marshall
16435,"Yeah, but where we're going to end?",Lily
16436,"First, let me tell you what happened on the wedding day.",Ted
16437,"Watching my mother to marry, I realized how I was late in relation to it on my life. I'm just going to leave here. So I walked into my hotel room and I went on a website where I go sometimes when I have trouble sleeping.",Ted
16438,We do not want to know what you do on the internet when you feel alone.,Lily
16439,I have not spent... It is not that part of the night I was talking about.,Ted
16440,"I was on my favorite site for real estate auction... Come on, we all did... visit some properties on the site.",Ted
16441,Guys... I just bought the house of my dreams.,Ted
16442,"What, are you saying that you bought the house?",Lily
16443,"I mean, I put an online auction and I won the next day and I was accepted. I have just finalized all the paperwork.",Ted
16444,"And that was fine with Blair Witch, and she tried to haggle on closing costs?",Barney
16445,"Try not to laugh with you that, man.",Marshall
16446,"So, I thought this piece would be the desktop. You see, a place just for dad. I mean, kids can come if they read a book, but no toy. This is not about to hold my love. It is rather a question of drawing a boundary.",Ted
16447,Whoa.,Robin
16448,"Ted, you're barge. It will take years and a small fortune for it to be liveable.",Lily
16449,"I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move.",Ted
16450,"Is it in the room with us right now, Ted?",Barney
16451,"Okay, okay. I know. I have not found Ms. Mosby yet, but I will get it. Knock on wood.",Ted
16452,"Look out, man.",Marshall
16453,"Ted, you can not go on like this where you will make your life. It does not work like that.",Lily
16454,"Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done.",Robin
16455,The dumbest thing that ON've ever done.,Barney
16456,"Okay, well. Ted let alone a little, right?",Marshall
16457,Thank you.,Ted
16458,"Okay? We all did stupid stuff in our lives. For example, I remember once when I put the rocket in the bathroom and tried to put them to dry in the microwave.",Marshall
16459,"My God, you had to be completely stuffed.",Robin
16460,"No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened.",Barney
16461,Children? Why...,Robin
16462,Put rockets in...,Barney
16463,"Oh, my God, guys! Great new game: &quot;Drunk or child? &quot;I was what? Guess.",Marshall
16464,Bourre.,Lily
16465,Bourre.,Robin
16466,Gamin.,Barney
16467,Gamin.,Ted
16468,"Drum roll, please. I was... Drunk!",Marshall
16469,"You know, I'm glad Robin have guessed. Because it is really sensitive and fragile. I talk about the times she cried during the song Clint. And while I whisper, I hope she hears me.",Barney
16470,It was not me!,Robin
16471,What?,Lily
16472,It's not me who cried during the song Clint.,Robin
16473,Are you crying?,Robin
16474,"I know it's silly, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?",Barney
16475,Not as much as me.,Robin
16476,I shall spin you 500 dollars if it happened to you instead of me.,Barney
16477,$ 500? No worries.,Robin
16478,"Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done.",Barney
16479,"Wait, you're...",Barney
16480,"Oh, great! I began to think that you would not come.",Ted
16481,Hmm.,Ted
16482,"Wait, wait. You will inspect the place where now?",Barney
16483,"Well, yeah.",Ted
16484,"Okay! Well! Well, just remember that we all did stupid stuff in our lives, okay? For example, once I tried to cycle on an extension ladder to a roof of a two-story house. The only question is I was a kid or drunk? Drum roll, please.",Marshall
16485,I was...,Marshall
16486,"A kid! Mom, are you? You always make a fuss about nothing.",Marshall
16487,"Hey, check the porch, huh? Go. I will put a gate there.Every Sunday here, it'll be a huge party sausage.",Ted
16488,Hmm... sausage party?,Marshall
16489,"Burgers, burgers will be made.",Ted
16490,"Ted, stop that. You can not keep this house. This is a huge mistake.",Lily
16491,"Lily, listen to me. I had a plan, right? A woman, a house, children, and it turned out that the universe is really shit to what is the wife and children. So what is the thing I can control? The house I bought. It's not a huge mistake.",Ted
16492,"Exactly. Now, I currently drive the car of my brother in the opposite direction on I-94. Now that was a big mistake. I was... a kid.",Marshall
16493,"Wow, Barney. You've been crying about this guy or what?",Robin
16494,"You see, you should have waited to see all the problems that home.",Lily
16495,"You can always have problems with any decision, but you can not let that stop you. First day in college, Marshall knew he wanted to spend his life with you. And if someone was there to contradict his decision?",Ted
16496,"I know this is our second hot date but, Lily Aldrin, I will marry you.",Marshall
16497,"But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.",Ted
16498,"It was Robin! &quot;What! &quot;Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know.",Barney
16499,"Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?",Robin
16500,Of course.,Barney
16501,"I made a mistake in letting you go, right? Your penis is huge.",Robin
16502,"Boy, you've almost had us still.",Lily
16503,You're always a little too far.,Marshall
16504,Shit.,Barney
16505,Really?,Ted
16506,And if I had already bought the son of a bitch?,Ted
16507,He said he had found a tramp?,Marshall
16508,"Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here.",Ted
16509,I see a complaint.,Barney
16510,"Hey, good, good news is that the inspector has k*ll some cockroaches at the time of impact.",Robin
16511,"Oh, stay there. Huge hole on the second floor. I just want to be sure the report is accurate.",Lily
16512,"You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie?",Ted
16513,Thank you. My God.,Barney
16514,Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house.,Ted
16515,"OK, buddy. Sometimes people make bad decisions in life. Like your mother.",Barney
16516,What do you mean?,Ted
16517,"Ted, as you know, I've always been really, really addicted to your mother.",Barney
16518,"Please, stop.",Ted
16519,"Actually, Virginia and I spent a special time in 2006.Before Clint.",Barney
16520,What are you talking about?,Ted
16521,I wanted to be your father!,Barney
16522,What does that mean?,Ted
16523,"Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that bastard stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport.",Barney
16524,And that's how you got the pin? Incredible. You... So... here we go.,Barney
16525,It is a good time. Not much traffic...,Barney
16526,Is it true? Hmm. I can... Listen... Ted's mother. I... I should really...,Barney
16527,Again?! One too many!,Marshall
16528,"Okay, that's good. Well, I invented the last, but everything else, I swear it was true. Come on, man. Your mother is a cougar.",Barney
16529,"Wait, I thought you said that a cougar could not be more than 50 years.",Robin
16530,"Okay, this is a Mellencamp.",Barney
16531,"Guys, I'm in trouble. I mean, the best I can do is to improve the house and sell the property with great losses.",Ted
16532,"Listen, Ted... Usually in life, when you make a huge mistake, you must learn to live with. But how many times you got the chance to take a mass break out and all?",Lily
16533,It's silly.,Ted
16534,Your mother and I were at second base.,Barney
16535,Thank you Lily. It was fantastic.,Ted
16536,"A Ted Mosby, owner, friends, and if he can rent it, Slumlord.",Lily
16537,There... there is one last thing I should do.,Ted
16538,It was our turn.,Robin
16539,Hi.,Ted
16540,"I have not been able to make your speech. I was selfish and I freaked out and I'm so sorry, so... and here... &quot;A hand sign for the Dj? Dee made the sign... &quot;I pass. &quot;Mom, I love you, and I've never seen him so happy with Clint. And Clint, welcome in the family... what you both is what I'd really like to have someday. But in the meantime, health to you both. I love you. &quot;",Ted
16541,Hey.,Ted
16542,"Hey, man.",Marshall
16543,How did you know that I would be here today?,Ted
16544,Robin told me. Happy Housewarming!,Marshall
16545,But I told you the last time I saw you I was coming home.,Ted
16546,"I know what you said. I also know my best friend, Ted Mosby. Listen... for all time, all the years I have told you... &quot;Slow! Not go too fast with this girl! &quot;You've not heard a single f*cking time. Your heart is both drunk and child.",Marshall
16547,"Please stay here with me, man.",Ted
16548,That's what I do.,Marshall
16549,I can... I can give you some ideas I have?,Ted
16550,Yeah.,Marshall
16551,"Well... it's a bit early... but... of course, I might consider... I moved here, let me think.",Robin
16552,"Yeah, that's what I was talking about me too. As I said, let me think. I agree.",Robin
16553,You said what?,Lily
16554,I thought about it.,Robin
16555,"You think about it? You hardly know him. In addition, the guy is a draw with a job that is worthless.",Barney
16556,"We have the same job, Barney.",Robin
16557,"And we could not be more proud of you, my angel.",Barney
16558,It still seems fast.,Lily
16559,You're probably right.,Robin
16560,You should live with him.,Ted
16561,Really?,Robin
16562,"Yeah, you're happy with him, and i adore you as a roommate, I want you to do what is right for you.",Ted
16563,You wanna throw me out because of something with milk?,Robin
16564,It's super boring.,Ted
16565,Robin?!,Ted
16566,No. I have a system. I put the empty brick in the fridge to remind us to buy milk.,Robin
16567,Why not let the solid brick to remind us not to buy?,Ted
16568,"All right. As a former... before you embark on anything, I'm meeting this guy. I think it's pretty weird not having yet met.",Barney
16569,"Bluntly. It's as if someone was orchestrating things for this specific purpose. Okay, but you must promise to behave well.",Robin
16570,I promise.,Barney
16571,"I'm doing this contortionist Portuguese, and I swear... it is so flexible, at a time, it was about me and beneath me. A top and a bottom! One and two! Which is empty?",Barney
16572,And it was Barney.,Robin
16573,"Actually, I'm not sure.",Ted
16574,"I appreciate you, Don. Both, we love a good scotch, one likes my stories compelling. And we went out with Robin.",Barney
16575,"The'm not, it's as if we had never been together.",Robin
16576,"In short, the arms of the Erasmus student have dropped and there fell of my swing. Seriously, I have not found a girl who can do that from Robin.",Barney
16577,"How was your weekend, or any other topic?",Robin
16578,Atrocious.,Lily
16579,Terrible.,Marshall
16580,Twin beds? I can not sleep in separate beds. We should complain.,Lily
16581,"Yeah, you're right, I'll ask for another room.",Marshall
16582,"Yeah, I'll go with you in just a second......",Lily
16583,You can come back later? It takes a nap.,Marshall
16584,We spent 18 hours.,Marshall
16585,We missed the full board.,Lily
16586,I lost 5 kg.,Marshall
16587,It's odd that we all still be friends with Barney.,Ted
16588,"Trainer with an ex okay, two at a pinch. Shit, two is even better. Because strawberry...",Ted
16589,"Wait, sorry. &quot;It? &quot;",Ted
16590,"Wait, wait. You think I'm gay? Why you would assume that?",Ted
16591,Your teacher of calligraphy called...,Robin
16592,And?,Ted
16593,Your ink arrived.,Robin
16594,Yes.,Ted
16595,Ted is not...,Robin
16596,But we still house boudoirs and hot dogs.,Ted
16597,Ted will not be much there. It follows Cher's tour.,Robin
16598,"Think again, Cher made some great concerts. But I'm not gay.",Ted
16599,Ted and Robin broke up there for years. This is not a problem.,Lily
16600,"I'm so gay, eh, Donnie?",Ted
16601,Thank you.,Ted
16602,It's just my friends.,Robin
16603,It should have separate beds.,Lily
16604,"Yes, a mini fridge. And separate beds.",Marshall
16605,a deal!,Lily
16606,"Well, there you should also apologize. We said some pretty hurtful.",Barney
16607,That was after you to be part.,Barney
16608,Sorry for not having told the truth from the beginning.,Robin
16609,Still not gay.,Ted
16610,It's great.,Ted
16611,"I can not wait, buddy.",Barney
16612,Thank you.,Robin
16613,"So long, guys.",Robin
16614,I have to get Robin.,Barney
16615,Are you kidding?,Ted
16616,"I do not know what it is, but I want to get Robin.",Barney
16617,I know what it is. You're like... a kid who threw his toys and wants them back as soon as another plays with.,Ted
16618,I had perhaps not done playing with. I just left to play with something else for a while.,Barney
16619,You ready.,Ted
16620,Ready for what?,Barney
16621,To read the letter.,Ted
16622,"Dear Ted future, never returns with Karen, because it is a pretentious snob. And she has deceived you. Sorry that you discover the way. You see? We laugh now.",Ted
16623,"Dear Ted future, stay away from Natalie. And girls who b*at you to the ground for no reason, before a cheering crowd. PS... Check out a shrink to find out why it has you a little excited.",Ted
16624,"Dear genius relations, Stella has left you at the altar, you'll love me maybe more. And you will surely die alone. It's not so sad written in calligraphy.",Ted
16625,Hanging out with Robin was a huge mistake.,Barney
16626,Write it.,Ted
16627,What?,Barney
16628,Write yourself a letter. That way you will remember the reasons for the break when you miss.,Ted
16629,My pleasure. Dear Barney... the future... This ink is too cool.,Barney
16630,Right?,Ted
16631,You... and Robin...,Barney
16632,"... a couple were atrocious. It did not work. You always love Robin, but remember the other women... And above all, the other breast, and all the cool stuff you do with breasts... Y to the head, juggle... squeaker squeaker... I'm a hopeless romantic.And there are drawings of breasts.",Barney
16633,Get it?,Ted
16634,I understand. I really want it back.,Barney
16635,"Humans are not made to share a bed. Sex and sleep are associated, but these are two different things.",Marshall
16636,"I know. I love you, but I want this new bed is a sanctuary of my sleep and my sleep only.",Lily
16637,"Me too. And snacks, but that's all. You know what we should do? Buy a third bed to make love.",Marshall
16638,A bed for sex. For hot sex and bestiality.,Lily
16639,"Awesome. That way, each bed will have its uses.",Marshall
16640,"Right. There will be two beds for sleeping, one for sex, and I thought an ottoman for birthdays.",Lily
16641,"Baby, you come to revolutionize modern marriage?",Marshall
16642,And how.,Lily
16643,"Don made sushi, it's cool, huh? He learned in Japan.",Robin
16644,It's too easy.,Barney
16645,"Be nice. You want it just because you can not have it. Like saying &quot;Sit wherever you want, except on that chair.&quot; You will be so...",Ted
16646,My chair!,Barney
16647,From spicy tuna? My favorite.,Lily
16648,"Me too, man. More than you, certainly. Instance. Super spicy. I feel bad.",Barney
16649,You will not believe. Don also has twin beds.,Marshall
16650,We just had.,Lily
16651,Wait. This &quot;super&quot; does not look great.,Lily
16652,But I bet you have no special bed sex.,Marshall
16653,This pepper is an ice cube in my mouth.,Barney
16654,I would love. If I move.,Robin
16655,Don Tokyo... You ever do that... in Japan? Wasabi!,Barney
16656,Great! Give her milk!,Ted
16657,"spit, spit!",Robin
16658,"Well, I hope you're happy.",Ted
16659,I stay on my position. It was bold and romantic.,Barney
16660,You were emptied from the top and bottom.,Ted
16661,Come on. Did you do stupid stuff to impress Robin.,Barney
16662,"Yes, but not anymore, because I turned the page. Just like you.",Ted
16663,"You have not turned the page. You want it as much as me, but you not admit it.",Barney
16664,That's ridiculous and I'll tell you why.,Ted
16665,For my biographer?,Barney
16666,"Concentrate on the letter, ok? At Ted, Robin is the ideal girl for you, but she will not engage. You need someone who wants to settle. So, until Robin is ready for this, it is not for you. I still remember stealing the blue French horn, our first kiss, her eyes when she told me she loved me. And shit. I want it back.",Ted
16667,I stole a blue french horn for her... I was with her for a year.I wanted her to be the mother of my children and spend eternity in his arms.,Ted
16668,"... I want to sleep with her, at least one last time. She is mine!",Barney
16669,"It's not for you! And it's not mine, either. It is... to Don.",Ted
16670,"Okay. We must get rid of him. You know, metaphorically.",Barney
16671,Of course.,Ted
16672,"Or... literally. That's how it starts! I'm afraid, Teddy!",Barney
16673,We all talk!,Ted
16674,I'm worried. I do not want that divorce.,Lily
16675,"This is Don. It's not us. Our new way to sleep is only going to get closer. Now, get out of my bed.",Marshall
16676,We can at least get closer?,Lily
16677,"Sure. You spoke of the beds. No, I'm not.",Marshall
16678,Why?,Lily
16679,"I love you more than anything, but you're worse than a kettle. I'm surprised that your pee breaks are not as steam.",Marshall
16680,You're not perfect either. Between the food and ants. But... I still want to be with you.,Lily
16681,"To hit me and slam me all night? I swear, as soon as you fall asleep, it looks like it push you arms. One would think sleeping with an Indian goddess.",Marshall
16682,We're getting closer?,Lily
16683,You speak of beds yet?,Marshall
16684,Nope.,Lily
16685,Come here.,Marshall

16690,"Okay, wait. What do you say to that? It is being shared?I take up to 40 years and after you can have it.",Barney
16691,Who we laugh? It is with Don. We must accept it and move on.,Ted
16692,You're right. I go to you... I go to the bathroom. And then I'll break...,Barney
16693,It's BarnExclussif.,Barney
16694,"BarnExclussif, not quit. I have a double appeal.",Robin
16695,It's Teddy Bear. Want some honey?,Ted
16696,"No. Ted, not quit. I'll remember. Ted is on the other line... and I think he has a problem.",Robin
16697,"Ted calls you? Indeed, he has a problem.",Barney
16698,What's the matter?,Robin
16699,There's that you have beautiful hair. Front and back.,Ted
16700,We almost lose control.,Ted
16701,It's true. I'm going to leave before something regrettable.,Barney
16702,"Robin, I love you!",Barney
16703,Species of bastard! I brought the blue French horn!,Ted
16704,"I brought the blue French horn! Ted has just given me.Sorry, I was there before you.",Barney
16705,I want you back!,Ted
16706,"All right! Here we go! You, Me and Ted!",Barney
16707,Something to three.,Ted
16708,"You abandoned easily. Game, set and match!",Ted
16709,We won the fingers in the nose...,Barney
16710,Where's this great TV?,Ted
16711,Thank you.,Robin
16712,"Good night, Dad.",Barney
16713,"It was good. Well, you gotta go.",Marshall
16714,What?,Lily
16715,"I'm sorry. It was great and you're great. But, I must get up early, so...",Marshall
16716,You throw me like that?,Lily
16717,You knew before you start. (Lily gets up to join his bed) Wait. Forget your sweater. Nice try.,Marshall
16718,"The Teddy Bear, BarnExclussif.",Robin
16719,Dad?,Barney
16720,"We get up, f*ck. You remember last night?",Robin
16721,"Damn, Ted was torn. Embarrassing...",Barney
16722,"I'm sorry. It is both. We drank and we were stupid, but... We will do everything we can to ensure that Don is part of the group.",Ted
16723,"Don will not be part of the group. Neither do I. At least for a while. Guys... with Don, it works well. I want to see where it goes. And I could not do it if I continue to hang out with my ex. It will not. I moved in with Don.",Robin
16724,So what's going on with Robin?,Barney
16725,"You were right, she was just angry. It's been four days and not talk to relocate. We must never repeat this kind of shit.",Ted
16726,"I agree. In fact... I even wrote another letter. Dear Barney the future, you think you want to get Robin, thou wilt not true. Let her. Sincerely, Barney's past.",Barney
16727,Let me see!,Ted
16728,Give me that.,Barney
16729,"Ps... The top was for Ted. He believed? Fine. Pull yourself together with Robin, but say nothing to Ted because he will still go wrong. And there are still drawings of breasts.",Ted
16730,"In my defense, the breasts, is not it great?",Barney
16731,Too great.,Ted
16732,Robin?!,Ted
16733,Guess what I have behind my back.,Barney
16734,"Wait, wait. I will find. Left.",Lily
16735,Not a good game but okay. Five tickets well placed to Robots vs. Wrestlers.,Barney
16736,Robots vs. Wrestlers?,Marshall
16737,Great!,Ted
16738,You know Robots vs. Wrestlers?,Barney
16739,No.,Marshall
16740,But we think some kind of sport in which robots wrestlers.,Ted
16741,"That's exactly it, according to the website!",Barney
16742,"Wait, wait. Who is the fifth ticket?",Lily
16743,"Uh... Robin. I know... She lives with her boyfriend and she said not wanting to hang out with us, but it's Robots vs. Wrestlers. Robots vs.... Wrestlers!",Barney
16744,Barney is right. It is impossible to deny that.,Marshall
16745,"I assume you're talking about cooking, otherwise I would have other issues.",Lily
16746,"I'm sorry, Lily, but I have a chance to Don. And I will not drink out with you every night... especially when &quot;you&quot; included two of my ex.",Robin
16747,I understand. You're right. We miss you much.,Lily
16748,"You too. I gotta go. It is called? (She hangs up) Sorry, New York, I had to answer. Where were we? Bus accident.",Robin
16749,She said no? How could she? Robots vs. Wrestlers of our tradition is the largest group.,Barney
16750,Tradition? It was never done.,Lily
16751,"It's Robots vs. Wrestlers, Lily. This is obviously a tradition. It starts like this. First, Robin moves in with Don and Marshall and Lily have a baby, then Ted...",Barney
16752,Goes?,Ted
16753,"I was going to say &quot;was found eaten by her cats,&quot; but it's not good either. Everybody leaves me, and I like it!",Barney
16754,Do not worry about a baby on our side. It is not yet started.,Lily
16755,Absolutely. A small road.,Marshall
16756,A small long road.,Lily
16757,But you can see.,Marshall
16758,"Very, very far.",Lily
16759,But you can see the exit sign.,Marshall
16760,Oh? I see it.,Lily
16761,You should put yourself on track.,Marshall
16762,"I understand how you feel. It is important friendship. In this regard, Emerson wrote a great poem, titled Friendship. You'll love it. &quot;A drop of crimson bl*od carries more weight than the waves of the sea...&quot;",Ted
16763,"You must try this Syrah. A taste of creme de cassis, red berries, oak heated... (Marshall and Lily are the kitchen while Ted sat on the bench) letter in September, baritone white. Of course! A lyric baritone! Which is higher than a bass-baritone.There is a key moment in the second act of La Boheme...",Ted
16764,"I try to add some class to our meetings. It's like this quote from Dante's Inferno. &quot;Consider the race of which you are created not to live like brutes but to follow virtue and knowledge.&quot;Or, in Italian original...",Ted
16765,You're right. I exaggerate with this story of Robin. What is an announcement? Wife Robin Don. I'll die alone! Ted eventually eaten by her cats!,Barney
16766,Relax... It's for Marissa Heller.,Ted
16767,"Marissa Heller? She looks good. Face, breasts, describe. Begins with the breasts.",Barney
16768,"Ted! It was our first post! It is popular. It was... a golf magazine for... Marissa Heller. A catalog of wicker furniture, also Marissa Heller. And a voucher for a bird shop... addressed to Marissa Heller... or check it out... &quot;Current Resident.&quot; It's us! It has mail!",Marshall
16769,Fantastic! That must be the previous tenant. I wonder how it looks.,Ted
16770,"And since, in every mail we receive, the picture becomes clearer. But we know not how it looks. I will follow it as always...",Ted
16771,Open it.,Lily
16772,"An invitation to the annual Spring Jefferson Van Smoot, for Saturday night... in his apartment in Alberta! Friends... This is the most beautiful building in Manhattan! We gotta go!",Ted
16773,"It depends, on the invitation, it's about robots fighting wrestlers to rule the galaxy?",Marshall
16774,It's about an open bar.,Ted
16775,We change the plan for Saturday. Evening Marissa Heller for alcohol and Robots vs. Wrestlers. But one of us should pretend to Marissa Heller.,Barney
16776,I'm flattered but Lily should.,Marshall
16777,This building is fabulous! You saw the gate and terracotta panels outside?,Ted
16778,I just got a text from Robin. It says...,Lily
16779,"Guys, we get together. Lil, you can do... All you have to watch the guy in front, say your name is Marissa Heller, and it passes. And I repeat, to be sure, no accent.",Barney
16780,"It is certain that it is not English, though? Okay! I do. I go there. (A young woman arrives) Sorry. Go ahead.",Lily
16781,Damn it then!,Lily
16782,That's Marissa Heller. She is pretty.,Ted
16783,She has beautiful teeth. It should not need the reminder cards to go to the dentist.,Marshall
16784,What do we do?,Lily
16785,"I do we go to the party, that's what! (He goes to Marissa) We met at the meeting of ornithophilic.",Barney
16786,Lovers of wicker?,Barney
16787,"I'm on it. This lift uses the same mechanism from its installation in 1906. It seems that Lamar Louis Skolnick, the architect of the building, has cut the panels himself.",Ted
16788,"And some French influence inside! He was an architect with a poet's soul, really.",Ted
16789,"I must make a confession. It is not on the list, but I always wanted to see the inside of Alberta.",Ted
16790,I said I'd get us.,Barney
16791,So... nobody saw The Young and the Restless?,Lily
16792,"Great! Who commissioned illustrated soap? Marissa Heller, I like your style.",Lily
16793,No one? Do I understand that there is not one fan of soap in this elevator?,Lily
16794,Prem's.,Ted
16795,I'm not dressed for it.,Marshall
16796,In a coined word &quot;asshole-Apocalypse.&quot;,Barney
16797,"This is Peter Bogdanovich, talking to Arianna Huffington and Will Shortz, crossword editors of The New York Times! Try at least, Chow and alcohol free. 20 minutes and off we go.",Ted
16798,"Sorry, you talk about the fourth book of madrigals?",Ted
16799,This is my favorite book of madrigals.,Ted
16800,You have nothing that resembles a mini cheeseburger?,Marshall
16801,Mini pizzas? French fries? Something that makes me think I'm a giant?,Marshall
16802,He will watch it.,Marshall
16803,This morning I made the heart of the Ambassador of the Netherlands. I hope he gets better.,Barney
16804,"You know who published an article on great Walt Whitman, and political semantics? Professor Hammersmith Oxford.",Ted
16805,"As Undersecretary of Finance, I had a great influence on this legislation. Now, I wonder if you will accompany me in the map room to stimulate my package.",Barney
16806,"Zsa Zsa Gabor is still sexy, but other than that, it is rotten this holiday.",Barney
16807,"We tried, it's been 20 minutes. We are going. Where is Ted?",Lily
16808,"I know how to find it. Just a second... (They clap a gong) gongs, eh? Stronger than we think.",Marshall
16809,It is the relic of his wife 500 years that has not been hit since WS Gilbert at the premiere of The Mikado in London in 1885.,Marshall
16810,"Friends, Will Shortz, editors of the Times crossword. You know, I always say they use &quot;Ulee&quot; of Gold Life for vowels? Tell them.",Ted
16811,Can I talk for a second?,Marshall
16812,"Ten letters, a diminutive egg pie?",Ted
16813,There. A great reception.,Ted
16814,Grave. We are going. It's time for Robots vs. Wrestlers.,Marshall
16815,"I missed that glitch. I know, do not bother to say. There's no glitch in the wine.",Ted
16816,Miss Lily in the living room with the chancellor.,Lily
16817,Sorry!,Lily
16818,"Look, I'm having fun here, so I'll pass Robots vs. Wrestlers.",Ted
16819,"But you never missed Robots vs. Wrestlers. It happens that way. First Robin us loose, and now you? And for those pretentious snobs and old game?",Barney
16820,"Actually, I like those pretentious snobs and they are not old fashioned fart noise when I open my mouth. I remain. See you tomorrow.",Ted
16821,It's an evening.,Barney
16822,It means nothing.,Lily
16823,"It means everything. If you come not to Robots vs. Wrestlers, it's the end of our friendship.",Barney
16824,See you tomorrow.,Ted
16825,"All right. So you do most of our group, forever. You can ask to return in 2 years. Come see wrestlers fight like robots. I'm embarrassed. I forgot something.",Barney
16826,"You know, a reading of poetry.",Ted
16827,The best tradition of all time!,Marshall
16828,"You crazy not me, Marshall. Let's be honest. The group is finite. Ted is gone, like Robin. That separates us as well.",Barney
16829,"Boy, Barney, stop with your abandonment issues. Ted has the right to have a life outside the group. As we all.",Lily
16830,"Wait. Why do you say that all of a sudden? My God, you're pregnant!",Barney
16831,No.,Lily
16832,"My God, have you ever had the baby! It is just behind me, huh?",Barney
16833,"No, silly. One day we all move forward in our lives. It's called growing up.",Lily
16834,You can at least promise to not get pregnant within a year?,Barney
16835,I can not.,Lily
16836,You can not?,Barney
16837,You can not?,Marshall
16838,"Citrus and honeycomb with a sharp acidity. This is a Sauvignon Blanc, Loire Valley. The town of Sancerre.",Ted
16839,No! You can not have children! You want to raise a child in this crazy world.,Barney
16840,The world is pretty cool right now.,Marshall
16841,"Okay, Lily, I have no choice. If you have a daughter, day, no, the minute she is 18... Gong!",Barney
16842,Babies.,Marshall
16843,I hope Ted is unhappy.,Barney
16844,"Thank you, Will Shortz.",Ted
16845,"Okay, you can have a baby, but only under the following conditions: 1-You promise to always love me more than the baby, 2-Once a month, I can use to shake the baby, 3 - It may include a drop baby from the first floor and that saves me; 4-No breastfeeding in front of me. Forget the five-four, get out your breasts when you want.",Barney
16846,Holy shit!,Marshall
16847,I can not believe!,Lily
16848,"Of course, hell is an interesting concept, is not it? I always liked to imagine it as Dante's Divine Comedy. If I may. Italian original... (Thinking...) I do not believe it. I recite the Divine Comedy in Italian original, and nobody makes fart noises. It's weird. I've never gone that far. I just seem to be an assh*le. My God, I control myself! Listen to me, I am completely let go! I'm the biggest assh*le on the planet. I wish someone stops me.",Ted
16849,I gotta run.,Ted
16850,"Rule number 83. If something out of the baby ends up on my costume, I can touch the breasts of Lily.",Barney
16851,"Dude, what's your thing with the breasts of my woman tonight?",Marshall
16852,It is not I who make the rules.,Barney
16853,Do you really think about all this?,Marshall
16854,I know. Maybe not.,Lily
16855,"For what it's worth, I think we are ready. We love, we are financially stable, and frankly, it would change that much the way we live.",Marshall
16856,"If being at home with a baby, tonight we have never seen a dead ringer for Ted. It would make you what, if we had missed it?",Lily
16857,I blame the boy for the rest of his life.,Marshall
16858,"Right, for his daughter's life.",Lily
16859,You're right. No need to rush.,Marshall
16860,"What do you say that? We agree that it makes no sense to have a child before he saw the five doubles, right?",Lily
16861,"Sure, it goes without saying.",Marshall
16862,"So when we finally see a dead ringer for Barney, this is the message of the universe to tell us to do. And at that time, we'll try. Deal?",Lily
16863,Deal.,Marshall
16864,"Look who thinks he can come here and repeat the group. Well, you can forget. Pity, remake the group! I want to lose anyone yet! We're sorry. You can recite all the poems of assh*le that you want, we never say anything bad on it, I promise.",Barney
16865,Really? Because there is a poem I would recite... Friendship of Ralph Waldo Emerson. &quot;A drop of crimson bl*od carries more weight than the waves of the sea The world uncertain comes and goes...&quot;,Ted
16866,"Sorry, someone had to. I pay my tour.",Robin
16867,Anyway... We were happy together.,Ted
16868,What...,Lily
16869,That's it. This is the problem.,Ted
16870,Her ass?,Barney
16871,Big?,Marshall
16872,Small?,Lily
16873,This is an access problem?,Robin
16874,"There will always be a bag. Even if it goes well, it ends one day by spoiling.",Ted
16875,Once in 30 years.,Barney
16876,"When I discover his luggage. I feel it. I do not know what it is, but when I know, it'll be over.",Ted
16877,"Please, tell me you repliest not emotional baggage.",Barney
16878,It's a good thing?,Ted
16879,The emotional baggage is the foundation of American cultural export the most important.,Barney
16880,"Actually, the p*rn. Only women with major baggage make p*rn.",Barney
16881,Everyone has one. You should know the face.,Robin
16882,"Really? The last time I overcame a background, it was that of a certain Stella, and, damn, I draw a blank. How did it end?",Ted
16883,"What happened is horrible, it does not mean that is the case for everyone.",Lily
16884,"Content that will be encountered young, not to be.",Marshall
16885,Issues mother.,Lily
16886,Not at all.,Marshall
16887,From grandmother.,Ted
16888,Certainly not.,Marshall
16889,On the great grandmother.,Barney
16890,I do not like it myself cuddly.,Marshall
16891,And you know your worst baggage? You're too nice.,Robin
16892,It's not a nice bag?,Marshall
16893,You've already looked walking down the street?,Robin
16894,I know not what to answer.,Marshall
16895,I'll help.,Robin
16896,"I'll help you. (It helps a man to repair his bike) That should do it. Guys, not today. It would be... (He begins to dance)",Marshall
16897,It's normal.,Marshall
16898,There is a street where it's normal. One clue: a giant yellow bird lives on.,Barney
16899,I would love that one bag of Royce or she is nice.,Ted
16900,"Gentile? This is the worst baggage. The best: she hates her father, and she believes to be big, but no. Steamy sex at first date, and have brekky, she left. Why are you with me?",Barney
16901,It does not b*at my pancakes. I'll make once. There are incredible.,Ted
16902,"What took you so, one time!",Robin
16903,It's nothing. Forget.,Marshall
16904,It was on his way and Marshall wanted to stop to help guys to load their van.,Lily
16905,To be nice. It cost nothing.,Marshall
16906,"And when the van is gone, which shows up if it is not the owner of the apartment, which had just been robbed help. And that was hard to explain to the police.",Lily
16907,"That's what I meant. New York is not a small town, friendly, crime-free, inbred, in the woods, with cows lost in Minnesota, where you've grown.",Robin
16908,"No crime? In 1994, the cashier of the grocery store was robbed. Besides, I like being friendly, okay? I will change not it.",Marshall
16909,"Do not change, baby. I find it pure. Pure. (Marshall gets up to the counter) Mashed mother of God is a moron sometimes. He lent them money to refuel.",Lily
16910,He gave them money?,Robin
16911,"Not given, lent. They said they would send a check, so Marshall gave our address. What prevents them from coming home one night, and maybe tie me? With Marshall, sometimes we pretend for real but it's terrifying.",Lily
16912,Why would you tell her anything?,Robin
16913,"What interest? He's from Minnesota. The mascot of his high school, it was a hug. Marshall is back with a beer while Ted joined them in turn.",Lily
16914,What was with Royce?,Robin
16915,Interesting. We went to this new film The Future Bride.,Ted
16916,"Was it good?! Not that I'm interested. This is for girls.But it could take me there, like, 7:10 p.m. at the session tomorrow, 9:40 p.m. where because of my meeting. But I will leave soon, we will try to 7:10 p.m..",Marshall
16917,"What's the movie about, anyway?",Robin
16918,This is where it's interesting.,Ted
16919,It's about me.,Ted
16920,The Future Bride talking about you?,Lily
16921,"You sure it's you? When I saw The Wild History of space, I would have sworn...",Marshall
16922,This is my story. It is written by Tony Grafanello.,Ted
16923,Tony Grafanello? This is...,Robin
16924,With him that Stella is gone. This film tells the story of our breakup.,Ted
16925,"Why would he make a film? It's not him, the villain?",Robin
16926,"Yes, nice and called Ted Mosby.",Lily
16927,"It's funny, it's also my recollection. But according to the film...",Ted
16928,I'm stunned.,Marshall
16929,Right?,Ted
16930,That's comedies these days? I fall off my chair! I really fell off my chair. It was funny.,Marshall
16931,What idiot. He chose a beautiful girl for my role?,Robin
16932,You're not in it.,Ted
16933,What a jerk!,Robin
16934,"No, Tony is not stupid. Well, not after the movie.",Ted
16935,I'm bigger than him.,Ted
16936,Once. I was on medication!,Ted
16937,Nothing.,Ted
16938,"This movie is really rotten! And everything is wrong!Remember my request? This spontaneous moment in the game room, I had no ring, so I gave him a teddy?",Ted
16939,It was cute.,Lily
16940,And romantic.,Marshall
16941,A little cutesy.,Robin
16942,That's how it was in the movie...,Ted
16943,And the hot date 2 minutes? When I condensed a romantic rendezvous in 2 minutes to go with the busy schedule of Stella?,Ted
16944,You're a good guy.,Lily
16945,It was really nice.,Marshall
16946,And a little cutesy.,Robin
16947,According to the film...,Ted
16948,"If you know what you do, 2 minutes.",Marshall
16949,Word expert.,Lily
16950,But the worst... the worst... it was the end. They are to marry...,Ted
16951,"Tell not the end! This is what I would say, if ever, I wanted to see a movie as bad. Continues.",Marshall
16952,So they are to marry...,Ted
16953,What is your problem?,Ted
16954,"He said &quot;Ted&quot;, right?",Ted
16955,"Okay, he really said this time around.",Ted
16956,Nothing.,Ted
16957,You must tell your story with Stella Royce. It will be released at one time or another.,Lily
16958,Why? So why should it?,Ted
16959,Because it is past the fifth most profitable films.,Robin
16960,I do not care. I will take it to my grave. It's a silly movie anyway!,Ted
16961,He looks like zero.,Lily
16962,I'll never see him out of friendship for you.,Robin
16963,That's exactly what happened. It was all good. Even the thing with nunchakus.,Barney
16964,"Yeah, that was good.",Ted
16965,"Bluntly. Well, technically, this is the correct pronunciation.",Ted
16966,Bluntly!,Ted
16967,"Bluntly! This guy's life was ruined by humiliation before the world. Too funny! It will take years before you can watch his family in front. It must be so traumatized that never again will he love or trust someone. It was insane! Get Moving, Adolf h*tler, a new king has arrived!",Ted
16968,I thought you would be interested to learn some stuff about this movie that you love. It is rotten. And you are all stupid to love.,Ted
16969,"You said &quot;not altogether, doll?&quot;",Lily
16970,You really used the phrase Jed Mosley?,Marshall
16971,I know! I was so excited... How do you know it's his sentence?,Ted
16972,I wanted to see Avatar.,Marshall
16973,It's good. I will emigrate to a country where nobody saw the bride.,Ted
16974,"Good luck. This film is international, it's great.",Robin
16975,Maybe North Korea?,Lily
16976,"I read that Kim Jong, he says it's his second favorite movie. Just after he made a film where the horse in slow motion.",Robin
16977,"Sorry, Ted, you're screwed.",Lily
16978,"No, you know, Ted is not screwed. You know why I'm nice? Because I'm crazy baggage people. Most people see another person with this big suitcase, and they spend doing nothing. But not me. I look at them and say, &quot;Hi, stranger. Can I help you? &quot;And you know who taught me to be like that? A Ted Mosby. A decent and sincere guy who has faith. And you know what, Ted? Inside you, you're still that guy.",Marshall
16979,I still am.,Ted
16980,You wanna go get that girl.,Marshall
16981,I want to go get that girl.,Ted
16982,For it is the love of your life.,Marshall
16983,"Because it is... Yeah, well... We had 3 rencards. It's nice.",Ted
16984,Because she's nice.,Marshall
16985,"It's really nice! You're right, Marshall. I have to go retrieve it.And I know exactly where it is.",Ted
16986,Royce!,Ted
16987,Ted?,Barney
16988,Barney?,Ted
16989,"I must say something. Long ago, I left that horrible daughter, Stella, break my heart. And now she is with this jerk who wrote a movie about it and this movie is called... The Future Bride.",Ted
16990,"I'm Jed Mosley. But Royce, missed it... in that cowboy boots red, it's not me.",Ted
16991,"To be clear, you're saying that you do not have boots red cowboy?",Barney
16992,What...,Ted
16993,I wanted... People want to know.,Barney
16994,They are g*n in fact. I promised I'd make pancakes.And... I would keep that promise.,Ted
16995,"Come on, darling, kiss him.",Barney
16996,This is outrageous. Thou hast embraced evil!,Barney
16997,"Royce, if you...",Ted
16998,Do I always appreciate... Would you like me to make pancakes?,Ted
16999,Kiss it! This film is embraced anyway.,Barney
17000,"That happened to me, it was pretty hard. I am not fully recovered.",Ted
17001,It feels good to have you said those things. I'm happy to open myself to you.,Ted
17002,"Wait, I thought you had a very small studio.",Ted
17003,"Yeah, you need to go there.",Ted
17004,"We agree, it's insane to have a child before he saw the five doubles, right?",Lily
17005,"Sure, it goes without saying.",Marshall
17006,"So when we finally see a dead ringer for Barney, this is the message of the universe to tell us to do. And at that time, we'll try. Deal?",Lily
17007,Deal.,Marshall
17008,You were serious with this story of the fifth lookalike?A baby is big enough to let the universe decide.,Marshall
17009,"I know, it's crazy. It's easier to let the universe decide. Why?",Lily
17010,Decided!,Marshall
17011,Wait 2 seconds! It could easily be Barney who tries to f*ck chicks.,Lily
17012,I've moved up.,Marshall
17013,Barney here.,Barney
17014,"Marshall. So, you're in the office? You're not, I do not know, driving a taxi, with a wig?",Marshall
17015,"Yes, I'm in the office. This is the sound of my stapler.This is the sound of my trouilloteuse. And that, the sound of me, ranking the company's directive on sexual harassment. What's new? I gotta run, great leader.",Barney
17016,Barney's office. It was the fifth double.,Marshall
17017,Marshall Eriksen... put a baby in my belly.,Lily
17018,"I hasten to add. This is one of the moments you dream about. &quot;Friends, Lily and I have unprotected relations. &quot;I have chills.",Marshall
17019,We're going to say anything.,Lily
17020,What? Why?,Marshall
17021,"If you tell them, they are invited in at the most private and intimate of our lives.",Lily
17022,"You kiss? Go on, I'm not even there. But just like that, have a baby: big mistake. Now, show me.",Barney
17023,"Uncle Ted is here! How you will handle the story of Santa Claus? You should be honest. Damn, I will disguise myself.",Ted
17024,Okay. I tell anyone.,Marshall
17025,We saw the fifth lookalike!,Lily
17026,Incredible!,Robin
17027,That's great!,Ted
17028,Bizarre. A Barney Brown.,Robin
17029,"I know. Say what you want about him, but Barney is better blonde.",Lily
17030,True. The blonde does not go to any guy.,Robin
17031,I'm not sure.,Ted
17032,What?,Lily
17033,"This was where I was swimming teacher at Cascade Country Club of Grief, I washed the mop with lemon juice, playing with natural highlights. Let's just say that there were some old pretending to drown. Unfortunately, one has really drowned. In short, blonde suits me.",Ted
17034,"I do not care, I can eat. Yes, we would like nachos.",Ted
17035,"I love you buddy, but it is impossible that the blond you go well.",Marshall
17036,It would not look good.,Robin
17037,"Yeah, seriously, Ted, you not discolor hair.",Lily
17038,I fade hair!,Ted
17039,It is not at all what we expected!,Marshall
17040,"Of course... the chemical stuff, yes. But, what grows in nature, they can try, like, a couple of times.",Robin
17041,"I think that we should not lie to kids, Moo-Moo!",Robin
17042,I've tried drugs.,Robin
17043,What was that for?,Robin
17044,I see...,Robin
17045,"Sorry. You do not know me. But I wanted to thank you.In fact, you are someone very important in my life.",Marshall
17046,"No, go ahead. I'm listening.",Ted
17047,"The executive producer of WNKW saw our show the other morning and I loved it. They offer me the position of presenter, starting next week.",Robin
17048,That's great!,Ted
17049,"Yes, but here's the thing... WNKW is...",Robin
17050,"Helen, dryer stops!",Ted
17051,Is Chicago.,Robin
17052,"You're the fifth double. How can you be you? I called you, Barney. And we talked about!",Marshall
17053,"Yes, I understand. My colleagues are oddly on the fact that I work. I know, I know.",Barney
17054,"To make them believe that I break my ass, when in truth I break some ass, I made a special message. What's new? I gotta run, Grand Chief.",Barney
17055,"It was a recording? You called me Big Chief, my nickname special job.",Marshall
17056,"Come, Grand Chief.",Barney
17057,Come on. Stops.,Marshall
17058,Why it happens now? While all was well with Don. This is the never ending battle of my life: career vs. love.,Robin
17059,"&quot;Endless Battle&quot;? Your career has crashed love for years.It's like the Globetrotters vs. the Generals. Crochet career in half, the love is greenhorns who deserve it the Italian league.",Ted
17060,I'm lost. What do I do?,Robin
17061,You really need to talk to Don.,Ted
17062,I'm too upset to talk with him. I have to avoid the time I decide what I want.,Robin
17063,"It sounds logical. Sorry to not be able to help you more than that. In truth, I can not be objective about the fact you're gone.",Ted
17064,You did a manicure?,Robin
17065,"No, I did not...",Ted
17066,Why are you brown taxi driver?,Marshall
17067,"Oh, that. You know how I dream of making love to a woman from each country?",Barney
17068,Sure. You're doing well in the Baltics.,Marshall
17069,I thought the fastest way to circumnavigate the world in 180 days. Take a taxi and wait before the United Nations.,Barney
17070,It was the perfect plan. There's a detail I had not expected.,Barney
17071,The girls not want to enter a taxi driver. I worked hard on it.,Barney
17072,I think so. I must confess to Lily that the fifth lookalike is false.,Marshall
17073,What's the problem?,Barney
17074,"Lily decided that once you have seen all the doubles, we try to have children.",Marshall
17075,Children!? No! Rule: no children under 45! You never read my blog!? He has improved a lot.,Barney
17076,"I'm ready to be a father, you know? But Lily needs a sign of the universe. It could take years.",Marshall
17077,"Sorry, pal. It'll be $ 37.50.",Barney
17078,"The universe has spoken. Marshall Eriksen, make a baby.",Lily
17079,"They told me, so I've prepared a few. I organize a &quot;marriage&quot;. Tell me, Billy Idol, it's going to do? More on Billy Idol.If someone wants the real Slim Shady, it's there. This one was good. Robin, why do not you help me?",Barney
17080,"First, I get lots of compliments. Then tell her.",Ted
17081,It gets no compliments.,Robin
17082,The other thing.,Ted
17083,It may be that I moved to Chicago next week.,Robin
17084,"Just to know, but it would do the same if we had not seen the Barney look-alike, eh?",Marshall
17085,"But we have seen, which means that the universe in its infinite wisdom, tell me of planting, and apply yourself.",Lily
17086,I can not. I can in good conscience you plant.,Marshall
17087,I know what's bothering you.,Lily
17088,Really?,Marshall
17089,The taxi driver looked like enough to Barney.,Lily
17090,"Well, there you got wrong.",Marshall
17091,Time out! This is a group decision! You can not go to Chicago before we are all agreed.,Barney
17092,I think Robin...,Ted
17093,"Stay out of it, Brigitte Nielsen and Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV! We need Marshall and Lily.",Barney
17094,It was smaller than Barney!,Lily
17095,It was the same size!,Marshall
17096,"And you know what? I think he was Asian. Yeah, this guy was a little Asian with a graying goatee and belly.",Lily
17097,You forgot what looks like Barney?,Marshall
17098,You kiss?,Barney
17099,Why are you in our room? (Robin's turn to...) Why are you in our room? (Followed by Ted) Why Ellen DeGeneres is in our room?,Marshall
17100,It works!,Ted
17101,Wait a second. Candles... flowers... I guess that Marshall has &quot;forgotten&quot; to tell you. The fifth lookalike... it was me.,Barney
17102,"What? Wait, you were aware? You lied to me?",Lily
17103,"By omission, because this idea of &quot;let the world decide&quot; is crazy.",Marshall
17104,"Baby, you...",Lily
17105,We must control our...,Marshall
17106,Friends! We forget what is really important here. Ted is blond.,Barney
17107,"Friends, I'm doing well. Robin has something important to say.",Ted
17108,It failed him.,Robin
17109,The other thing.,Ted
17110,He had a manicure.,Robin
17111,The other thing.,Ted
17112,I had a job offer in Chicago.,Robin
17113,That's why we're all here. For Robin to deter...,Barney
17114,"Actually, I already made my decision. Friends, I must accept.",Robin
17115,I can not believe that Robin is going to lose.,Ted
17116,"And besides, it was a big mistake. I will re-stain the hair.",Ted
17117,Finally.,Lily
17118,I told you so.,Marshall
17119,Not so great that.,Barney
17120,So I was on the phone with Chicago.,Robin
17121,"Yes, I made my decision. I appreciate the offer, but I can not accept it. Thank you.",Robin
17122,I'm staying.,Robin
17123,"Tell me... Did you see the real Barney driving the taxi, and you thought it was a little Asian pot-bellied.",Marshall
17124,"I know. It's weird, huh?",Lily
17125,It's not weird. That means you're not ready. Sorry for wanting to rush things. Our baby can expect the real dead ringer for Barney.,Marshall
17126,Hello Moo-Moo! Monty did you do an extra-fine pizza just as you love them! Are you okay?,Robin
17127,You said what?,Robin
17128,Barney?,Marshall
17129,It's just a guy we know who has a blog and really bad.,Marshall
17130,This is something that was cool 8 years ago.,Marshall
17131,What's your name?,Lily
17132,how Kristof?,Lily
17133,Really? Your last name is &quot;Sosie&quot;?,Marshall
17134,I'm going.,Robin
17135,"I can. Good luck in Chicago, Don.",Robin
17136,"Barney, why are you doing this?",Lily
17137,Wait a second. Is it possible that Barney Stinson secretly hope they have children?,Marshall
17138,Let me talk about him. He keeps saying that nobody should have children before 45 years.,Lily
17139,"But I think I know what happens. Yesterday, Barney felt obliged to say goodbye to someone he really likes. And it made him think... A baby joining our group might not be the worst thing.",Lily
17140,"And one day he will be the best uncle in the world. Because it Barney, he is part of our family.",Lily
17141,Excuse me a moment. Estonia Baltic countries would complete!,Barney
17142,Say yes to that.,Robin
17143,Yes.,Ted
17144,I can re-move? (Ted takes her in his arms. They sit on the couch) Is I'm the biggest idiot in the world?,Robin
17145,"Think of all of us, five years ago, when we met you.Marshall and Lily were friends as little. Today they are married and think about the children. And Barney? He would never get involved with anyone. And last year, he fell in love. And me? I was chasing a girl, convinced she was right. Today it is one of my best friends. And you? 5 years ago, you would never put love before your career, but now you did it.",Ted
17146,Seems like I become more and more stupid.,Robin
17147,"Just more courageous. We all looked for the 5 lookalikes.But eventually, over time, we all become our own doubles.These completely different people who look exactly like us. The &quot;Robin, there was 5 years&quot;? This girl was pretty cool. Robin lookalike? She's great. (They are close) We drank a lot.",Ted
17148,I do not care.,Robin
17149,"What? I forgot, I'm blond. I have blonde hair.",Ted
17150,Yes! You're there! This is fantastic!,Lily
17151,"Calm down. Your husband is here. Trying to hide it, at least.",Barney
17152,"The friends, follow me! (They leave) Look! The fifth double.",Lily
17153,This guy looks like me...,Barney
17154,Guys... Play the game,Marshall
17155,It's amazing.,Marshall
17156,Is not it?,Lily
17157,It looks like Barney.,Robin
17158,Amazing.,Ted
17159,It's like looking in a mirror.,Barney
17160,Does that mean...?,Marshall
17161,Marshall Eriksen... put a baby in my belly.,Lily
17162,Nice! Where'd you get this?,Ted
17163,Stashed a cooler behind the pulpit. Beer be with you.,Marshall
17164,"And also with you. Man, this is what church has been missing. Dude, you fixed church.",Ted
17165,"Yeah. You're welcome, God. Nervous?",Marshall
17166,What? No. I'm just hoping it doesn't rain. Why? Do I look nervous?,Ted
17167,"Look at your beer, dude. You always do that when you're nervous.",Marshall
17168,"Barney, I really... I have to grade these papers.",Ted
17169,"I'm sorry. I'll let you work. But first, a riddle: What piece of women's attire most stokes a man's desire?",Barney
17170,A sun dress.,Ted
17171,"Correct. What lightweight outfit, pink or white, makes the front of my slacks abnormally tight?",Barney
17172,I really have to get this done.,Ted
17173,"Of course, of course.",Barney
17174,Thank you.,Ted
17175,"&quot;Sun dress,&quot; by the way. Hey! What are you nervous about? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. What flowing cotton frock...",Barney
17176,"Okay, I'll tell you. Just... There's a... There's a girl sitting at the bar. Don't look!",Ted
17177,I want to see a pretty girl.,Barney
17178,"Okay, you can look. Just-just-just be cool for once.",Ted
17179,"I'll be cool. Ah, Ted. You got your beer label in a bunch over nothing. Listen to your Uncle Barney. You have no reason to be nervous. None whatsoever. And I'm going to tell you why in one word.",Barney
17180,And what's that word?,Ted
17181,Dibs!,Barney
17182,What... You can't call dibs on a girl I've been sitting here thinking about maybe talking to eventually at some point.,Ted
17183,You never called dibs.,Barney
17184,Dibs were implied.,Ted
17185,Implied dibs?,Barney
17186,Yeah.,Ted
17187,"Ted, you are spitting on the grave of Sir Walter Dibs, inventor of the dib. It was 1652... The SS Dibs was lost at sea...",Barney
17188,"Look, I don't have time for a fake history lesson, so I'll keep this simple. You go over there and talk to that girl, I will see you in court.",Ted
17189,And who's gonna represent you? Dibs on Marshall as my lawyer!,Barney
17190,Damn it!,Ted
17191,Where is Marshall anyway?,Barney
17192,"Okay, I'm almost ready to leave. Let's just go through the checklist. Candles?",Marshall
17193,Check.,Lily
17194,Music to set the mood?,Marshall
17195,Check.,Lily
17196,Music for when we're actually doing it?,Marshall
17197,Check.,Lily
17198,You know what? To hell with your dibs. I'm going over there right now and talking to her.,Ted
17199,"Oh, yeah, yeah? Be my guest. Fall in love with her. Get married. Just know this: When I step up to make my toast as your best man...",Barney
17200,"Actually, Marshall would probably be...",Ted
17201,As your best man...,Barney
17202,Ladies and Gentlemen... I... had dibs.,Barney
17203,No!,Ted
17204,What?,Barney
17205,I had implied dibs.,Ted
17206,"Shhh, shh. You're the v*ctim here. We both are. Let's get out of here.",Barney
17207,We could just do it right here.,Barney
17208,Fine. Have at it. Exercise your dibs. She's got her shields up anyway. She's reading a book.,Ted
17209,"Yeah. At a bar. That book might as well be called, &quot;Are You There, Barney? It's Me, Horny.&quot; That is not what &quot;shields up&quot; looks like. (<em>He points to Robin who is entering the bar, with greasy hair and dirty clothes</em>) That is what &quot;shields up&quot; looks like.",Barney
17210,"Move. God! (<em>She come over Ted and Barney's table</em>) Hey. 'Sup, dudes? Fries?",Robin
17211,"Oh, good God, woman. You're a disgrace.",Barney
17212,No fries for this guy.,Robin
17213,"Robin, seriously, I love you, but it's like you have squiggly cartoon odor lines coming off of you right now.",Barney
17214,"You know what, Barney? Just cut her some slack, okay? She just went through a breakup.",Ted
17215,With hygiene?,Barney
17216,"Here, have some tea.",Ted
17217,Thanks.,Robin
17218,"Robin, I am here for you. Whatever you need.",Ted
17219,"Okay, about that. Ted, listen. I know myself pretty well. And, some time over the next few months, I'm going to want to sleep with you. And when that happens, you have to try to say no.",Robin
17220,Try? I will absolutely say no. Our friendship is too important.,Ted
17221,"Okay, you know, maybe I wasn't clear enough. I will come at you with everything I've got. I will stalk you like the lioness stalks the gazelle: careful, patient, deadly. And if you let your guard down for so much as a second, as sure as you were born, I will hump your brains out.",Robin
17222,"Okay, I'm ready to have sex now.",Robin
17223,"It was a tough summer, but I think our girl's been a real trooper. She's... Is this a Cheeto?",Ted
17224,"No, we ran out of Cheetos last week. Oh, yeah, it's a Cheeto. Dibs.",Robin
17225,"Oh, you're exquisite. You must let me paint you.",Barney
17226,"Hey Robin, what do you think? The girl sitting at the bar. Shields up?",Ted
17227,"Mmm, totes, toots. She's here on a date. She brought the book because she got here early, and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting. Girls like to come across all classy and smart, you know? <em>(She gets a giant hamburger out of a paper bag)</em>",Robin
17228,This? What you're doing right now? I'm getting a &quot;de-rection.&quot;,Barney
17229,Hey! How'd it go? You pregnant yet?,Ted
17230,Nope!,Marshall
17231,"Okay, so, here's what happened. I was at home, waiting for Marshall.",Lily
17232,"Hey! How was your day? Don't answer. No time. Bedroom. No, no. No time. Floor. No, no time. Against this wall!",Marshall
17233,"Marshall, whoa! Wait. A big package just arrived.",Lily
17234,"Yeah, it did.",Marshall
17235,"No, no. It's a real package from your dad.",Lily
17236,"Well, that's a little weird, but yeah, it is.",Marshall
17237,"Marshall, look!",Lily
17238,"A bassinet? Oh, my... He must've made it in his wood shop. Wasn't that sweet of him? Lil? Isn't that sweet? Lily?",Marshall
17239,You told your dad we're trying to have a baby?,Lily
17240,Of course I did. I tell my dad everything. My dad is my best friend.,Marshall
17241,"We have been looking forward to this magical, special night for two weeks now. And, sweetie, during that time, I have been... How do I put this delicately? Saving all my love for you.",Marshall
17242,"I have read 11 books on conception. I have cut out alcohol, caffeine and sugar. I take my temperature every hour. But good for you for not playing with yourself.",Lily
17243,"I feel you, buddy.",Ted
17244,"Ah, no! Don't even touch me, dude. It's been, like... It's been two weeks. I'm, like, a light breeze away from having a big problem. Seriously. <em>(He looks at Robin, picking her teeth)</em> Okay, I'm better now.",Marshall
17245,"Okay, Barney. What's this going to cost me?",Ted
17246,Excuse me?,Barney
17247,Your dibs. I want to buy your dibs.,Ted
17248,Two... hundred... and fifty thousand dollars.,Barney
17249,20 bucks.,Ted
17250,But I... Can I go smell her first?,Barney
17251,No. <em>(He takes $20 out of his wallet)</em>,Ted
17252,Fine. <em>(He takes the money)</em>,Barney
17253,All right. Wish me luck.,Ted
17254,What the hell are you doing?,Barney
17255,That girl she's talking to? I dated her.,Ted
17256,"Oh, that sucks! And dibs.",Barney
17257,"So you went on one date with one of her friends. It's not necessarily a big deal. I mean, did it end on bad terms?",Robin
17258,"Well, I guess you just got to move on. I mean, it's not like you have a sh*t with Ready McGee over there, right? Ted?",Robin
17259,I got to see her ankles.,Ted
17260,"You're one of those? God, I swear, one in five guys...",Robin
17261,"Lily! We kind of had a plan tonight, remember? Candles? Banjo?",Marshall
17262,Who else did you tell? Did you tell anyone at the office?,Lily
17263,Shannon? Start the music...,Marshall
17264,"I may have mentioned it in passing to a couple of colleagues at work. I'm sorry about that, but you know what? I got to be able to tell my dad.",Marshall
17265,"Your dad is the last person you should tell! The man is too involved in our lives! It's like, every time the phone rings...",Lily
17266,Hello.,Lily
17267,Hello.,Lily
17268,Hello.,Lily
17269,Pickles would have helped that sandwich!,Marshall
17270,The man has no boundaries. And I just can't procreate under these conditions!,Lily
17271,"Yeah, well, you know what? I've already told him, so the damage is done.",Marshall
17272,"So, call him and tell him we decided not to have a baby.",Lily
17273,"Okay, so you just... You want me to give my dad a stroke?",Marshall
17274,Only if you want to give this a stroke.,Lily
17275,"That's ridiculous. Lily, there is no way that I would ever... Okay, everyone needs to shut up so that I can think!",Marshall
17276,They're talking to a guy now.,Robin
17277,What kind of guy? A cheesy guy or a cool guy?,Ted
17278,"Oh, a cheesy guy. Don't worry.",Robin
17279,"Oh, man! That guy is cool. His hair's all cool, he's got a cool belt.",Ted
17280,"Well, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy. Who's feeling nachos?",Robin
17281,"Oh, look at you, Robin. You're jealous.",Barney
17282,Jealous?,Robin
17283,"Yeah, jealous, because she's got it, and you've lost it.",Barney
17284,I have not lost it.,Robin
17285,You lost it.,Barney
17286,"I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want.",Robin
17287,"Robin, girls are like cartons of milk. Each one has a hotness expiration date, and you've hit yours. I'm not saying the occasional guy won't still open the fridge, pick you up, give a sniff, shrug and take a sip anyway But it's all downhill from here.",Barney
17288,I don't have to take this. But I do have to take this.,Robin
17289,"Okay, so you just want me to call my dad and tell him that we're not having a baby?",Marshall
17290,"Okay, out of curiosity,when do we tell him about the baby?",Marshall
17291,We'll tell him about the baby when there's a baby to tell him about.,Lily
17292,"So, he just gets no notice? He just walks into his boss's office, and says, &quot;I just had a grandson. I'm gonna be out for three months.&quot;",Marshall
17293,Out for three months?,Lily
17294,Yeah. He and my mom are coming to live with us when the baby's born. We talked about this.,Marshall
17295,"No, we didn't.",Lily
17296,"I meant, me and my dad.",Marshall
17297,"You know what, Marshall? Why don't you have a baby with your dad?",Lily
17298,"Oh, okay, Lily.Why don't you have a baby with your butt?",Marshall
17299,What?,Lily
17300,I can't think straight! Why do you have to wear that shirt? This is not how I thought this night was going to go!,Marshall
17301,"Oh, God, this sucks! Do you think she saw me?",Ted
17302,"Yeah, she definitely saw you.",Barney
17303,"Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her.",Ted
17304,"Okay, will do. And dibs.",Barney
17305,"Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right?",Lily
17306,"Oh, you don't want my opinion on that.",Barney
17307,Why not?,Lily
17308,"If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him.",Barney
17309,That was really...,Lily
17310,"Whoa, a hottie with a body! Boing...!",Barney
17311,Brief.,Lily
17312,"No. Lily, look. <em>(looking at Robin standing at the bar)</em> You saucy little minx. You sundressed up.",Barney
17313,"14 seconds! 14 seconds, and already some dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off. I... still... got... it. All right, buddy, you proved my point. Now scram. Nice belt, by the way.",Robin
17314,"Robin, you do look super hot.",Barney
17315,"Oh, do I?",Robin
17316,"Yeah, you do.",Barney
17317,Thanks.,Robin
17318,"Or set me up with one of your friends. No, I'm kidding. That would be weird.",Ted
17319,"It wouldn't, would it? Any one of those three. Whichever's easiest and right nearby. And not the beer.",Ted
17320,Totally.,Ted
17321,Say good-bye before you leave?,Robin
17322,Her words exactly.,Ted
17323,"Dude, you are so in. That is so awesome. A high five doesn't even cut it. High six!",Barney
17324,"She didn't see us high-six, did she?",Ted
17325,No. Good. That was pretty lame.,Barney
17326,"Yeah, let's never do that again.",Ted
17327,Marshall?,Lily
17328,"What? Lily, what? Are there more members of my family that you want to crap all over?",Marshall
17329,Here's the thing.,Lily
17330,"I'm sorry. Hold on. Just... It's my dad. Lily, it's my dad, okay? I love him, and if he calls me, I'm gonna answer the phone! Hey, Dad.",Marshall
17331,"Dad, this is...",Marshall
17332,"Dad, I'm in the middle of something right now.",Marshall
17333,"He's insane. My dad is insane. I'm so sorry, Lily. He's just... He's so... enthusiastic. It's ridiculous, you know? Like, who's like that?",Marshall
17334,"You. You're like that. You and your dad both care so much. It's... it's why women fall in love with the Eriksen men to begin with. But right now, it's a lot of pressure.",Lily
17335,"Baby, I'm not trying to pressure you one bit.",Marshall
17336,What if I can't have a baby? That could happen. I could totally let you down. Has that thought not occurred to you?,Lily
17337,"Not even for one second. Not having a baby would suck, but the idea of you letting me down... that's impossible. That would be like aliens landing. That's a bad example, because that could happen. It probably already has. I saw this, episode... All right.",Marshall
17338,I'm doing this. I am going over there. Wish me luck.,Ted
17339,"Like I said, she's here on a date.",Robin
17340,"Okay, maybe I'm a little nervous.",Ted
17341,"Dude, it's just a wedding toast.",Marshall
17342,"I know. I just... I want it to be great, you know? I want this whole day to be great.",Ted
17343,It will be.,Marshall
17344,Best man? You're being summoned.,Lily
17345,"Geez, what now?",Ted
17346,"Ted, seriously, relax. Everything's... Okay, and it's raining.",Marshall
17347,Yeah. You were saying?,Ted
17348,"You didn't happen to bring an umbrella, did you?",Marshall
17349,No. I didn't bring an umbrella.,Ted
17350,"I mean, everyone told us that it might take a while, but... We thought we might be the exception to the rule. Anyways, we're getting back on that horse. I mean, feeling good about the future. Obviously, this goes without saying, but you won't tell Lily about any of this, right?",Marshall

I can't. I just... I can't. Guys, I know you count the minutes until you can escape from your humdrum lives by hearing how awesome mine is, and I love doing that for you, but I just can't tonight.",Barney
17353,What's wrong?,Robin
17354,I don't want to talk about it.,Barney
17355,"Okay. Hey, you guys see Deadliest Catch last night?",Robin
17356,Did I ever! Deadliest Catch ever!,Ted
17357,"All right, I'll tell you! My mother is selling the house I grew up in. All of my childhood memories gone, just like that!",Barney
17358,"That sucks. I've been there, buddy.",Ted
17359,What are you talking about? Your mother still lives in the house you grew up in.,Marshall
17360,"With her new hippie husband, Clint. The comfort of home is a little ruined when someone turns your old room into what I'm pretty sure is a Tantric sex temple. With all the bamboo, pot smoke and '60s music, it's like my old G.I. Joes are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback.",Ted
17361,"Anyway, I need you guys to come out to Staten Island on Saturday and help box everything up.",Barney
17362,You expect us to spend a whole day packing up your mom's house?,Lily
17363,Of course not. It's a two-day job.,Barney
17364,Pass.,Robin
17365,Same.,Ted
17366,Unsubscribe.,Marshall
17367,"You guys are adorable. You seriously believe that I, Barney Stinson, can't talk you into this? I got the Queen to give me a fist bump.",Barney
17368,No one believes that story.,Ted
17369,"You may be able to talk the brain surgeons you pick up into doing whatever you want, but it's not gonna work on us.",Lily
17370,How did he do that?,Lily
17371,"Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box.",Barney
17372,"Yeah, that's what your mom said.",Ted
17373,How dare you!,Barney
17374,"No, she actually said that.",Ted
17375,Bro!,Barney
17376,How you doing?,Ted
17377,Mom. Stop.,Barney
17378,Tuesday at work. Some of the senior partners are really getting up there.,Barney
17379,"So, Ted, yesterday at work, I totally talked you up to that super-hot makeup girl, Liz.",Robin
17380,Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. What did you say?,Ted
17381,"Oh, you know, how funny you are...",Robin
17382,Guilty.,Ted
17383,Handsome.,Robin
17384,"Who, me?",Ted
17385,Incredible lover.,Robin
17386,Really?,Ted
17387,"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I was all like, &quot;He knows a woman's body better than she knows her own, endless waves of pleasure just cresting and breaking for hours and hours...&quot; Blah, blah, blah. &quot;Orgasms so intense that you just black out.&quot; All that stuff.",Robin
17388,"Robin, how can I possibly live up to that review?",Ted
17389,"What? You know what you're doing down there. Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it. We know this.",Robin
17390,"But that is not the point. I mean, you broke the first rule of setting people up: undersell. It's like, if someone's never seen The Karate Kid, you don't say, &quot;It's the greatest movie ever.&quot; You say, &quot;Uh, it's pretty good&quot; And then they see it, it blows their freakin' mind. Because Cobra Kai sensei's all like, &quot;Sweep the leg!&quot; And Daniel-san's all like... (high-pitched vocalizations, (mitates whooshing sounds)",Ted
17391,Maybe I did oversell you a bit.,Robin
17392,"Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world?",Lily
17393,"I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",Barney
17394,"I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",Barney
17395,That sounds plausible.,Marshall
17396,"Hey. It's true. Tell him, James.",Barney
17397,"Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this...",Barney
17398,"&quot;Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10:00 in the morning, she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool. Love, Postmaster General.",Barney
17399,Thank you.,Barney
17400,Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot?,Marshall
17401,Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?,Barney
17402,"Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too?",Robin
17403,Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth...,Barney
17404,Damn. Loretta really lied a lot to her kids.,Ted
17405,"Well, she's not alone. Whenever Marshall was acting too hyper, his mom would suddenly decide he was &quot;sick&quot; and give him cough medicine until he passed out.",Lily
17406,"I'm pretty sure that's what stunted my growth. I hit 6'4&quot; in the fifth grade, and then I just stopped.",Marshall
17407,And then there's the most popular parental lie in history. Santa.,Lily
17408,"Yeah, but that's a good lie. Like when we tell Ted he'll meet the right girl and settle down.",Marshall
17409,I always find that reassuring.,Ted
17410,"You will meet her, buddy.",Marshall
17411,You think so?,Ted
17412,Yeah!,Marshall
17413,"Santa's still a lie, and I'm not lying to our kids.",Lily
17414,"Baby, it's Santa. Don't you want our kids going to sleep on Christmas Eve with their hearts full of hope, their heads full of crazy cough syrup nightmares, knowing that downstairs Kris Kringle is stuffing their stockings full of joy and stuffing his belly full of milk and lutefisk that they left him?",Marshall
17415,Milk and lutefisk? Santa doesn't get cookies in Minnesota?,Lily
17416,"Yeah, that's just what Santa needs at 3:00 a.m. when he's battling a snowstorm over the Rockies: a sugar crash. No. Santa needs protein.",Marshall
17417,I'm not lying to our kids.,Lily
17418,Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class.,Barney
17419,"Yeah, school girls... The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't... Who's Sam Gibbs?",Barney
17420,Mom addressed this and never sent it.,Barney
17421,"Hey. (laughs) It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote... &quot;Your son.&quot;",Barney
17422,"I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom!",Barney
17423,"So, Ted? You were worried that I oversold you to Liz. Well, I fixed it.",Robin
17424,How?,Ted
17425,"I sent her another email. &quot;Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound like I was trying to oversell Ted. The truth is, he is a genuinely nice, down to earth guy, and I think you two would really hit it off.&quot;",Robin
17426,Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect. That totally takes the pressure...,Ted
17427,"&quot;Is he going to rock your world in bed? No. But he's clean, open to criticism, and not into anything too weird. He's not bad at all. Not bad at all.&quot;",Robin
17428,"See, now you went too far in the other...",Ted
17429,&quot;I'll be honest. The first few times aren't going to be that great. He's going to say 'Are you finished?' more times than a waiter in a busy restaurant.&quot;,Robin
17430,Stop!,Ted
17431,"Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker.",Barney
17432,"I suppose you have a problem with the Easter Bunny, too.",Marshall
17433,Not now.,Lily
17434,"So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy.",Barney
17435,Maybe we shouldn't have brought these Sloppy Joes.,Marshall
17436,"Oh, what's done is done.",Lily
17437,&quot;Ted Mosby is solid as a rock.&quot; No. &quot;Dependable.&quot; No. &quot;Rugged.&quot; No.,Ted
17438,Why don't I just go to the Chevy Web site and copy down adjectives?,Robin
17439,I just want to hit that perfect middle ground.,Ted
17440,"How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out? &quot;Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, and really rich, but lacks bladder control.&quot; Oh, damn.",Robin
17441,What?,Ted
17442,That last bump just made me hit send.,Robin
17443,"Oh, no.",Ted
17444,Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke.,Robin
17445,"No, they won't. They're going to think... Wait. &quot;Everyone&quot;?",Ted
17446,&quot;Really rich&quot;?,Barney
17447,"For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop. Just... just give me a second, okay?",Barney
17448,"Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really... you know. I'm not crazy. I just... I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up.",Barney
17449,"God, this must be so hard for Barney.",Lily
17450,"Yeah, but you know what? He took a big step today...",Marshall
17451,"Papa! Look at us!nIt's like three of the same guy. Oh, my God, this explains why I was always so awesome at basketball. Guys, I'm black! Sorry. African-American. No. I'm allowed to say either. I got to go get my camera!",Barney
17452,"Wait. Barney and James are two years apart. If Sam only knew Loretta for a few months, he couldn't possibly be Barney's father.",Ted
17453,He's also quite the detective.,Robin
17454,Don't worry. We'll... We'll snap Barney out of this when he gets back.,Lily
17455,"Or, he could just let him have this one.",Marshall
17456,What?,Ted
17457,Are you kidding?,Lily
17458,"Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home, he finally admitted Bob Barker's not his dad, and then he watched James meet his real father. It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon. Can't we just let the guy be black for a day?",Marshall
17459,"Here, Ted. Capture the moment!",Barney
17460,"I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl.",Ted
17461,"Man... I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about.",Barney
17462,Weird day.,Robin
17463,Weird day.,Ted
17464,"Hey, look at that! Liz still wants to meet you. That's great!",Robin
17465,I guess. Wait a minute. You said Liz was a total ten. Why would she want to meet the incontinent freak show you described? You oversold her!,Ted
17466,Maybe a little.,Robin
17467,You said she was a ten.,Ted
17468,I did not specify on what scale.,Robin
17469,You said she looked like a movie star.,Ted
17470,"She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear.",Robin
17471,"Dad, look how fast I can run!",Barney
17472,"Dad, you're not looking!",Barney
17473,"Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I... I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top?",Barney
17474,Are you sure?,Barney
17475,"What'd Coach say, Ma?",Barney
17476,Why didn't anyone come?,Barney
17477,"It's okay, Mom. I don't need it.",Barney
17478,I already have a father. And his name... is Loretta.,Barney
17479,Wait. Dad! James! Where are you going? That's the best part. Can we go camping?,Barney
17480,"Unfinished. Of all the words you could use to describe La Sagrada Familia... Brown, pointy, weird... The one that really seems to stick is &quot;unfinished.&quot; Why? Because on June 7, 1926, the architect Antoni Gaudi... Whose beard was also brown, pointy, weird and unfinished......was run over by a bus. And so, his greatest masterpiece would remain forever...",Ted
17481,"Ted, look across the bar. Three chicks: one hot, one kind of hot and one who I'm assuming is really funny. We ride! What's wrong?",Barney
17482,I don't know. Got a burger coming.,Ted
17483,"Bro, I told you, if you ever need a wingman, I'm your guy.",Marshall
17484,"Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again.",Barney
17485,Hi. Barney Stinson.,Barney
17486,"And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman.",Marshall
17487,Thank you for your time.,Barney
17488,Fine. I'll have a three-way with hot and kind of hot while Giggles works the camera. I ride!,Barney
17489,"So, get this: Last night, I was watching TV, and it turns out, some random satellite channel picks up a certain local Chicago newscast.",Robin
17490,"Oh, man, it's bad enough to have to go through a horrible breakup, but then have that person pop up on your TV? Are you okay?",Ted
17491,"Well, I'll admit, at first, I felt a little weird. But after the initial shock, I realized something: I've moved on. Finished with that. It was a peaceful moment of closure.",Robin
17492,That's great. Good for you.,Ted
17493,"Yeah, thank you.",Robin
17494,"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
17495,Excuse me?,Robin
17496,"When I was a kid, I had a dog named Bean. Whenever he made the face that you're making right now, you just knew he pooped somewhere in the house. Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
17497,I don't know what you're talking about.,Robin
17498,"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
17499,There's no poop.,Robin
17500,Where's the poop?,Lily
17501,Okay. So it wasn't entirely a peaceful moment of closure.,Robin
17502,"Hey, Don, here's some breaking news: there's a zit breaking ou on your forehead. Finished with that.",Robin
17503,"Look, I'm not proud, but Don left so quickly that I never got the chance to have that final showdown. So yelling at him, even on TV, felt kind of good. And you know what? Now I truly am over him.",Robin
17504,That's great.,Ted
17505,Thank you.,Robin
17506,"Good for you. Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
17507,"Damn it! Okay, in the process of truly getting over him, I may have called him and left an... indelicate voice mail.",Robin
17508,"I am gonna k*ll you. I'm gonna fly to Chicago, k*ll you, put your stupid face on a deep dish pizza and eat it. And then maybe catch a Bears game. But mostly the k*ll and eating your face thing.",Robin
17509,Give me your phone. We're deleting Don's number.,Lily
17510,Don't worry. I am never doing that again. It was a one-time thing.,Robin
17511,Prove it. Delete contact.,Lily
17512,There. Deleted.,Robin
17513,"Back already. How was flying solo? And by &quot;solo,&quot; I mean so low that you got sh*t down.",Marshall
17514,"Look, I didn't get sh*t down. Trust me, I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. This is all part of the plan. After initial contact, I'm now in the ignoring phase.",Barney
17515,"Barney, why can't you just take a girl out to dinner like a normal person?",Lily
17516,"Golden rule: I do not buy dinner to get the yes. Dinner's a very intimate activity. It requires a level of connection and eye contact that sex just doesn't. Call me old-fashioned, but I need to have sex with a girl at least three times before I'll even consider having dinner with her.",Barney
17517,"What are you doing here? Oh, God! You're dating one of my students. It's Rachel, isn't it? Barney, I know she wears provocative sweaters, but she's 19! Now I'm gonna have to hear all about it, right? Go on, tell me every detail.",Ted
17518,"No, you pent-up old perv. I brought you a present. Recognize this?",Barney
17519,It's my building.,Ted
17520,"Do you remember how awesome it was to be co-workers... Nay, bro-workers?",Barney
17521,Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean...,Ted
17522,"Ted Mosby, it's back on. We're gonna build your building.",Barney
17523,"This is awesome... You're designing our new headquarters. Now, there will be voices that tell you a hockey rink on the roof is unfeasible. You've got to shut those voices out.",Marshall
17524,"Actually, I think I'm gonna say no.",Ted
17525,No? Are you kidding me?,Robin
17526,But designing a building in New York City is your lifelong dream.,Lily
17527,"I do not want to work for GNB again. Those guys are evil. No offense, Marshall.",Ted
17528,"Dude, none taken. Yes, GNB is, the Empire from Star Wars. But the Death Star's gonna get built either way. And don't you think the architect of the Death Star is pretty psyched to have that thing on his space resume? I mean, yes, his design was flawed in the sense that a single b*llet fired into a particular vent would explode the whole thing.",Marshall
17529,"For all we know, that was the contractor's fault.",Ted
17530,"But that won't happen on your watch... you know why? Because you're Ted Mosby! And you are gonna design the most beautiful, ventless, Rebel-proof building in Manhattan, with clearly marked emergency stops for every trash compactor on the detention level.",Marshall
17531,"Look, I know this is hard to understand, but right now, I have a quiet, simple, happy little life. And I like it that way. I know what my answer has to be.",Ted
17532,"I can't take the job, Barney. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings?",Ted
17533,Of course not.,Barney
17534,All right.,Ted
17535,"I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Barney, back me up. Barney. Dude, this is important.",Ted
17536,I need another drink.,Barney
17537,"Marshall, you want anything?",Ted
17538,"No, I'm fine.",Marshall
17539,"Okay, I get that he's mad at me for turning down the job, but acting like I'm not even here?",Ted
17540,"Wait, you turned down the job? When?",Marshall
17541,This morning.,Ted
17542,"That's so weird. Just, like, an hour ago, when we were leaving work...",Marshall
17543,"So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job?",Marshall
17544,Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes.,Barney
17545,Am I wrong or is that exactly what Barney says when he's putting the moves on a girl?,Ted
17546,"Exactly. I mean, it's almost like he's putting the moves on you.",Marshall
17547,"Yeah, more like the opposite. He's been ignoring me all night. Barney wants me to take the job so bad he's putting the moves on me?",Ted
17548,"I hope that's his end game. Actually, I don't. I like you two together.",Marshall
17549,"I don't buy it. That's crazy, even for Barney.",Ted
17550,"Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl?",Marshall
17551,"Chrissy, I love your glasses.",Barney
17552,They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy.,Barney
17553,The backhanded compliment to lower her self-esteem... a proven winner.,Marshall
17554,But Barney hasn't done...,Ted
17555,"Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community. You stick with it. To Ted.",Barney
17556,"Hey, Lily!",Robin
17557,"Don't &quot;Hey, Lily&quot; me. I smelled poop all the way from the hallway.",Lily
17558,"Oh, no, not this again.",Robin
17559,"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
17560,"Okay, I left Don another message.",Robin
17561,&quot;This just in&quot; is what I'm gonna say when I'm stabbing you.,Robin
17562,But that's impossible. You deleted his number.,Lily
17563,"I tried to. But then this thing popped up on my phone that said, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; And I wasn't sure. I can't lie to my phone.",Robin
17564,"Oh, sweetie, I totally understand. Delete it!",Lily
17565,"It's not that easy, okay? You're not just deleting a number, you're deleting a part of your life. You know, all those memories, all those experiences. It's like you're admitting they're gone forever.",Robin
17566,"I know, sweetie. I know. Delete it!",Lily
17567,"Okay, if it's that easy, I'm gonna delete one of your numbers from your phone, see how you like it.",Robin
17568,"My &quot;plezh.&quot; If you can find a number in there that I don't call regularly, I'll gladly delete it.",Lily
17569,Super Kicks Karate.,Robin
17570,"No, not that one. That's my dojo.",Lily
17571,You have a dojo?,Robin
17572,I took an introductory karate class.,Lily
17573,"Ops, wrong room. Where do the grown-ups go for the real karate class?",Lily
17574,Of you? Please. I'm a kindergarten teacher.,Lily
17575,But I'm totally gonna sign up for more lessons.,Lily
17576,How long ago did you take that class?,Robin
17577,"I don't know. It was around the time when everyone was going, &quot;Wassuuuuuuup!&quot;",Lily
17578,"How do you even remember that? Lily, this is a number that you will never dial again.",Robin
17579,I might.,Lily
17580,"No, no. But you keep it in your phone because it reminds you of a version of yourself that you could be, even if it's a version of yourself that you'll never become. And that's okay.",Robin
17581,"No, it's not. Okay, you know what? There, gone. Your move, Scherbatsky.",Lily
17582,I finally know what your kind goes through. I get it now.,Ted
17583,"For the last time, I don't care how big it was, it is not the same as giving birth.",Robin
17584,No! Barney's been &quot;putting the moves&quot; on Ted.,Marshall
17585,"Oh, that sucks. Although I like you two together.",Lily
17586,"No, he's been doing it to try to get Ted to design the new GNB Tower.",Marshall
17587,Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?,Robin
17588,"Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks! (...) Man, the courtside Knicks seats that are available to all upper level GNB employees are too close to the action. I keep getting sweat on my suit. It sucks! (...) Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks!",Barney
17589,He did.,Ted
17590,And the intense eye contact thing?,Robin
17591,"So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers?",Barney
17592,Okay. Yep.,Ted
17593,And the thing where he establishs intimacy through physical contact?,Robin
17594,You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese.,Ted
17595,That is so true.,Barney
17596,Yeah... Cream cheese has a mild flav-flavor so it... it balances out the spiciness of the jal... the spiciness of the... Dude!,Ted
17597,"So at any point in this did you say, &quot;Barney, I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. I am not taking that job&quot;?",Robin
17598,"Well, I mean, not exactly in those...",Ted
17599,You're loving this.,Lily
17600,No.,Ted
17601,You are. You're loving the attention.,Lily
17602,"It's nice to be wanted, okay? And, yes, this is a new vest. Thank you all for noticing. Oh, that's right, you didn't. Barney did!",Ted
17603,"Oh, Teddy, you are so going to spread your legs and design that building.",Robin
17604,I am not that kind of architect. So get this...,Ted
17605,Robin never deleted Don's number.,Lily
17606,"Oh, everyone thinks it's so easy. Give me your phone. Let's delete one of yours.",Robin
17607,"Okay. No problem. If you can find a number that I don't need or shouldn't have in here, be my guest, but good luck. I keep my phone tight.",Marshall
17608,Edwin.,Robin
17609,"Oh, no, not that one. That's the booker for the club that my band plays at. You know, my all-lawyer funk band... you remember... The Funk, the Whole Funk and Nothing but the Funk.",Marshall
17610,You guys played one gig four years ago. I'm deleting it.,Robin
17611,"No, no, we're gonna... we're gonna play another gig again. Probably really soon. It's just we all got super busy, and... We're not going to play another gig again, are we?",Marshall
17612,"Probably not, baby.",Lily
17613,"See, it's hard to hit that delete button, isn't it?",Robin
17614,"Well, it's just that without that number in my phone, I'm just a corporate lawyer working 60 very un-funky hours a week.",Marshall
17615,"Sorry, Marshall. But if I have to, you have to.",Robin
17616,Okay. Your turn.,Lily
17617,"Barney, I gotta tell you something.",Ted
17618,"Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you?",Barney
17619,Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower.,Ted
17620,"Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else.",Barney
17621,"Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, &quot;pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more.&quot; It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, &quot;Oh, God, I never should have said no.&quot;",Ted
17622,"It's not a move, dude. I executed the paperwork for the new architect this morning. Barney wasn't lying.",Marshall
17623,"Oh, God, I never should have said no! Come on, GNB didn't really hire a new architect. This is just one of Barney's moves.",Ted
17624,"It's not a move, dude. The senior partners were getting impatient. I thought you didn't even want the job.",Marshall
17625,I didn't! I don't! I don't. I don't!,Ted
17626,"Okay, I'll do it!",Ted
17627,"What? Ted, it's too late.",Barney
17628,I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.,Ted
17629,"Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank...",Barney
17630,"Okay, it's a move.",Marshall
17631,What?,Ted
17632,Dude!,Barney
17633,"There is no other architect. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied. I was being Barney's wingman, and I never get to be the wingman.",Marshall
17634,You guys lied to me?,Ted
17635,You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here.,Barney
17636,I can do better. Take me back. You son of a bitch!,Marshall
17637,"Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me.",Ted
17638,We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job.,Barney
17639,"No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women...",Ted
17640,236.,Barney
17641,"...before me fell for. Wow, respect.",Ted
17642,"No... Ted... you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me.",Marshall
17643,"Come on, Ted! This is your dream.",Barney
17644,"No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no.",Ted
17645,"Hey, guys.",Robin
17646,"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
17647,"How do you do that? You are like a b*mb dog, except with poop. You are a poop-sniffing dog.",Robin
17648,I think that's just called a dog.,Marshall
17649,"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
17650,Fine. I called Don again.,Robin
17651,"Hey, Don! It's Robin again. Look, I am sorry for all the calls. It's just, I saw you on the news, and it made me a little crazy for a minute. I guess I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought. But I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to k*ll you. No... No, I'm not. I am happy for you. And that Asian slut on your Facebook page. She's dead, too.",Robin
17652,I thought you deleted his number.,Lily
17653,"I did, but it turns out, I memorized it. You can't delete contacts from your brain, Lily.",Robin
17654,"Well, you have to try. If you ever want to have closure...",Lily
17655,"I am never going to have closure. Okay? Closure doesn't exist. Okay, one day, Don and I are moving in together, and the next thing I know, he's on a plane to Chicago. It just... ended. And no matter how much I try to forget that it happened, it will have never not happened. Don and I will always be a loose end. We'll always be...",Robin
17656,"Unfinished. Gaudi, to his credit, never gave up on his dream, but that's not usually how it goes. I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy, weird church from getting built. Most of the time, it's just too difficult or too expensive, or too scary. It's only once you've stopped that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it. But it's always there. And until you finish it, it will always be...",Ted
17657,"Hey, Barney. Hey, Rachel. Rachel, why aren't you in class?",Ted
17658,"Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class? You son of a bitch. I'll call Marshall. We'll draw up the contract.",Barney
17659,Not so fast. I'm not that easy.,Ted
17660,Who is this?,Robin
17661,"I'm sorry. Is this 917-456... I'm sorry, 465... No, wait.",Robin
17662,Sorry. Wrong number. Finished with that.,Robin
17663,"Hey, punk! Bit of advice. Next time you step on a kindergarten teacher's neck, you better finish the job.",Lily
17664,I cannot stop staring at that girl's face.,Barney
17665,Face. Huh. That's your weirdest nickname for boobs yet.,Ted
17666,"No, Ted, I'm really looking at her face.",Barney
17667,Aw... That's actually really sweet.,Lily
17668,"Puffy cheeks, smudged mascara, slightly red nose... That girl was just crying. She's so sad and defenseless. Anyone have a condom?",Barney
17669,That's it! You know what? Five-minute time-out! Corner booth! Now.,Lily
17670,"I don't know, it could be cool. I've never seen Woody Allen.",Robin
17671,I have seen plenty of other famous people. Last week I saw... Maury Povich.,Robin
17672,"Dude, everyone sees Maury Povich.",Lily
17673,"I am, too, a real New Yorker.",Robin
17674,That's adorable. You're from Canada.,Ted
17675,I have been here for almost six years. It's not like I just got off a boat.,Robin
17676,"A boat! Oh, wait, that is how you say it.",Lily
17677,I'd say you're not a real New Yorker until you've stolen a cab from someone who needs it more than you do.,Ted
17678,"No, you're not a real New Yorker till you've cried on the subway and not given a damn what anyone thinks.",Lily
17679,"No, you're not a real New Yorker until you've k*ll a cockroach with your bare hands.",Marshall
17680,"Those rules are all stupid, okay? I've never done any of those things.",Robin
17681,"Okay, time's up. What are we talking about?",Barney
17682,"Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's, and Robin thinks that we should go see him.",Marshall
17683,Why would I do that? I'll see him at poker on Tuesday.,Barney
17684,"Oh, come on, if we jump in a cab, we'll be there in 15 minutes.",Robin
17685,"A real New Yorker would know the subway's faster. You just take the one, and transfer to the two-three.",Lily
17686,"Well, the bus runs more often on weekends. Take the M-7 to the M-5.",Ted
17687,"The bus? Every time I take the bus, there is one crazy person no one wants to sit near. That's why I have never taken the bus. Plus... I can run faster than a bus.",Barney
17688,"Dude, that's, like, seven miles. You can't do that. You can't b*at the bus!",Ted
17689,I can b*at a bus or a cab or a train!,Marshall
17690,Is anyone else suddenly craving green eggs and ham?,Robin
17691,"Machines are overrated, and someone needs to take them down a peg.",Marshall
17692,"You're all wrong... I got a way to get there so fast, I could b*at all of you, even if I sat down and ordered a big, juicy steak first.",Barney
17693,How?,Marshall
17694,"Medium rare. But that's not important right now. Look, I know the city better than any of you guys, okay?",Barney
17695,"Oh, my God!",Lily
17696,"Oh, wow!",Barney
17697,"All right, all right, hold on, hold on! Let's just forget about it. Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway. First person there wins! <em>(Everyone stand up et run outside)</em>Doesn't matter how you get there!",Ted
17698,(<em>to the sad girl at the bar)</em> Stay sad! I'll be back!,Barney
17699,"Hi. Can I see a menu, please? No rush.",Barney
17700,"It's gonna be positive. Eriksen man are hella fertile. When Uncle Morris was 16, he got his girlfriend pregnant just by holding her hand too tight in the backseat of a car. Now I'm thinking my parents lied to me.",Marshall
17701,Negative.,Lily
17702,"Negative? Well, we know it's not me.",Marshall
17703,Everything's fine. These things take time.,Lily
17704,"Not with an Eriksen. Something must be wrong with you. Also, my mom hates you.",Marshall
17705,"You know what? Just to make sure, I'm gonna pee on this again.",Lily
17706,"What? No, you wouldn't. Somebody help me! Somebody help me!",Marshall
17707,I'll show them. My body can outrun any motorized vehicle. I'm like John Henry when he b*at the steam engine. All I need is a great folk song.,Marshall
17708,"Suck it, grand-butt!",Marshall
17709,"Ooh, taxi!",Robin
17710,Track maintenance? 20-minute delay?,Lily
17711,"I grew up here, I speak conductor. Damn it! <em>(she gets off the train)</em> Damn it!",Lily
17712,Grademyteacher.net?,Ted
17713,"It's this awesome site where students can go say what they really think about their professors. Hey, you're probably on there.",Marshall
17714,Here's a fun fact. See the Alberta Building over there?,Ted
17715,That's the gray one. Did you know that in 18...,Ted
17716,Hey! Come on! Elizabeth!,Barney
17717,"Excuse me, I've got a thing.",Robin
17718,"Gregor's Steakhouse, downtown.",Robin
17719,"Downtown hospital, please. It's right by Gregor's Steakhouse. Take the FDR, and maybe crank up some smooth jazz.",Barney
17720,"Oh, no. <em>(He makes a phone call)</em> It's Barney. Help me.",Barney
17721,Hi.,Robin
17722,"Hi, Becky. My, you're perky.",Robin
17723,Oh...,Robin
17724,Keep it.,Robin
17725,"Ranjit, take me to Gregor's.",Barney
17726,"Hey, Christine.",Marshall
17727,"Well, you're in luck. See that gothic church over there? Those corinthian columns were designed by Giuseppe Pegatto in 1896. <em>(the woman stands up to find another place)</em>",Ted
17728,"Hey, Ranjit, pull over.",Barney
17729,"Hey, toots! How about a ride? Oh. Hey, Robin, it's you.",Barney
17730,See that over there? That's the old Arcadian Hotel. Fun fact... While today its neoclassical fenestration is considered to be... (<em>the driver suddenly pulls the breaks</em>),Ted
17731,"So, is this ride your way of apologizing for this morning?",Robin
17732,I'm sorry. I never apologize. And why would I?,Barney
17733,Are you kidding me?,Robin
17734,"Hey, Barney, can I talk to you?",Robin
17735,Sure. Stand a little more this way. I'm scouting some talent. Pretend we're talking about something important.,Barney
17736,"Oh, well, this... This is something important. Um, I'm having a... A really rough time at work. You know, the whole Becky thing...",Robin
17737,"Oh, you know what? That's just getting distracting. Um, say &quot;carrots and peas&quot;. Carrots and peas. Guys, I can't stop staring at that girl's face.",Barney
17738,"What, you really had something to talk about?",Barney
17739,"Yes. Look, I've spent the last,six years in this city, focusing on my career, all for nothing. Some lady almost got me k*ll. Maury Povich stole my cab. I swear, this city is starting to reject me like a bad organ transplant. You know, everyone keeps saying that I'm not a real New Yorker. Well, maybe I should just stop trying.",Robin
17740,"Robin, I had no idea.",Barney
17741,"No, it's my fault for thinking that you might care. Ranjit, stop the car.",Robin
17742,"No, don't stop the car.",Barney
17743,"Seriously, stop the car.",Robin
17744,"Look, you... Wait, wait... Robin, hold on. If you want to talk, I'm right here.",Barney
17745,Carrots and peas.,Robin
17746,Don't... You...,Barney
17747,Uses a hybrid steel tube structure...,Ted
17748,Whoa! This is crazy.,Marshall
17749,I can't believe it.,Robin
17750,"Okay, this is clearly a sign. Let's just call it a tie. Forget about the race. Head back to the bar.",Ted
17751,"Oh, God. Oh, bite me!",Robin
17752,Faster. Mush! Mush! I need this win. I need this win.,Barney
17753,"And firing half my department freed up the money to double my own salary. And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group.",Barney
17754,"And I smell incredible. Smell me. Just, seriously, smell me.",Barney
17755,Stop! Too slow. Switch.,Barney
17756,Sweetie? Are you okay?,Lily
17757,No. I am done with this city. It wins. I just want to move somewhere new and start over.,Robin
17758,"You've had a rough year. But you're tough. And I love you like crazy. If you left, I'd have to follow you. And Marshall would follow me. And Ted would follow him. The only upside is that we might get rid of Barney. Bring it in.",Lily
17759,What did he say?,Robin
17760,"No clue. Hey, is that Maury Povich?",Lily
17761,Hey! Lily.,Robin
17762,"Sorry, sweetie. I swear I'll be a great friend at the finish line, but the conductor just said you're going express to Borough Hall, which means you're screwed, sweetie. So long, sucker<em>. (the doors of the train opens)</em> Damn it. <em>(she makes a phone call)</em> Hey, it's Lily. Help me.",Lily
17763,"And not a single passenger would listen to me. I mean, am I a bad teacher? Do I just put people to sleep?",Ted
17764,The machines have won! he machines have won.,Marshall
17765,I can't do it. I can't run that far. I can't outrace anything. I... I can't... I can't get my wife pregnant!,Marshall
17766,Wait. Is that what this whole stupid running thing has been about?,Ted
17767,"My body has been letting me down, and I just wanted to prove that it could still do something, but it can't.",Marshall
17768,"Dude, you've been trying for two months, not two years. That's nothing.",Ted
17769,"Well, you should talk. You know, you're the one who's freaking out because you have one mediocre review and, like, 50 great ones.",Marshall
17770,64. But whatever.,Ted
17771,"And you're designing a frickin' building. I mean, come on, dude.",Marshall
17772,"Marshall! Marshall, get in!",Lily
17773,There it is.,Ted
17774,Where are Marshall and lily?,Robin
17775,Who cares?,Barney
17776,I won? I won!,Robin
17777,No!,Barney
17778,I can't believe I won!,Robin
17779,How did that even happen?,Barney
17780,"Okay, he's in. Go. Go. g*n it.",Lily
17781,Run him over.,Lily
17782,"No. Lily, what the hell is the matter with you?",Marshall
17783,Nothing. I just want to win this really badly. So badly that I just ditched my best friend when she needed me.,Lily
17784,"Oh, baby, you were also going to run over Ted.",Marshall
17785,Why did I get so crazy about this?,Lily
17786,"Maybe for the same reason that I kept saying that I could run seven miles. I... I'm trying to be really, um, confident and positive about all this, but, baby, I'm really scared that we're not pregnant yet.",Marshall
17787,"Oh, thank God. I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.",Lily
17788,I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.,Marshall
17789,It's only been two months.,Lily
17790,We are crazy.,Marshall
17791,We're totally crazy.,Lily
17792,This is the last time it's ever going to be just the two of us. Shouldn't we be enjoying that?,Marshall
17793,We gotta go back to Paris.,Lily
17794,And take ballroom dancing.,Marshall
17795,And really learn how to ski. Not just up and get faced in the lodge.,Lily
17796,"And see Coney Island. I've still never been. See, we have a whole bucket list of things to do before we start having kids.",Marshall
17797,"Oh, a cradle list.",Lily
17798,"I'm... So glad we're trying, and I'm going to be really excited for when it happens, but this isn't a race.",Marshall
17799,It isn't a race.,Lily
17800,"Ranjit, screw Gregor's. Let's go to Coney Island.",Marshall
17801,I won!,Robin
17802,No!,Barney
17803,"So I said, &quot;the cab, of course&quot;",Robin
17804,I know what you did back there.,Ted
17805,"Yeah. Check it. I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks, and I still smell incredible. Smell me.",Barney
17806,I'm not gonna... Not gonna...,Ted
17807,Smell me.,Barney
17808,"Wait a minute. So, where is Woody Allen?",Robin
17809,"Damn it, Max. That's Maury Povich.",Robin
17810,"I love your idea about a giant rooftop ring of fire you can jump through with a motorcycle, but I tweaked it slightly and... This is still super bad-ass. It's now a patio garden where you can bring a nice bag lunch.",Ted
17811,Sick. Yeah. Dude. Working together is gonna be legen... Wait for it. I'll send you an inter-office memo with the rest 'cause we freakin' work together!,Barney
17812,"Oh, big news. The board finally settled on a site for the building.",Barney
17813,"Uh, no, thank you. Still got it.",Ted
17814,"Barney, we have to talk.",Ted
17815,Sure. What's up?,Barney
17816,"Not now, Trish!",Barney
17817,&quot;Dary.&quot;,Ted
17818,"Legendary! So, what's on your mind?",Barney
17819,I can't design the building.,Ted
17820,"Oh, yeah.",Marshall
17821,"Oh, baby. No, no. Not the slipper socks with the rubber soles. I work so hard to-to set the mood, and-and when I see those, I feel the egg go right back up my Fallopian tube.",Lily
17822,"Baby, these satin sheets are slippery. Papa needs traction.",Marshall
17823,Traction?,Lily
17824,"As you know, Papa likes to get down with enthusiasm.",Marshall
17825,Please stop calling yourself &quot;Papa.&quot;,Lily
17826,"And without traction, Papa's likely to boogie himself right out of bed. It's either these or soccer cleats.",Marshall
17827,"Hey, so I talked to Robin. I guess she and Max hooked up last night.",Lily
17828,Nice! I love that guy. Max is both his name and his level of awesomeness.,Marshall
17829,"Yeah. He's a sweet guy. She feels really comfortable with him. They bonded over hockey. I guess he has a small penis, but they want to double-date next weekend.",Lily
17830,Why would you tell me that?,Marshall
17831,So you'll clear your schedule.,Lily
17832,No! The other part!,Marshall
17833,"Oh, the small penis thing?",Lily
17834,Ah! Don't! Stop saying that! Why do you keep saying that? You... I don't want to know that. I'm not going to be able to look the guy in the eye. I'm certainly not going to be able to call him &quot;Max.&quot;,Marshall
17835,"That's insane. I mean, just because you know Max has a small penis...",Lily
17836,Just don't!,Marshall
17837,You're kidding me.,Barney
17838,"I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave?",Ted
17839,Snakes.,Barney
17840,Did you just say &quot;snakes&quot;?,Ted
17841,"I don't recall saying &quot;snakes&quot;. Ted, I know you love crappy old stuff no one cares about. But I'm gonna give you four words to live by: New is always better.",Barney
17842,New is always better?,Ted
17843,You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better.,Barney
17844,Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?,Ted
17845,Everything.,Barney
17846,"So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?",Ted
17847,Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law.,Barney
17848,"And when you're at a g*n n' Roses concert, you're like, &quot;Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy&quot;?",Ted
17849,"Axl's really matured as a songwriter, Ted.",Barney
17850,Wendy! I'd like to buy my friend a drink. What's your oldest Scotch?,Ted
17851,Amazing. And what's your newest scotch?,Ted
17852,"Your call, buddy.",Ted
17853,"A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch sounds lovely. Lots of ice. New is always better, Ted! That's a rule. Just like bigger is always better!",Barney
17854,"Pff. That's not true. Uh, sometimes smaller is better. &quot;Hey, look how big my cell phone is!&quot; You don't hear people say that. No. You want something compact and efficient that fits comfortably in your pocket, and I think Max is just a great guy.",Marshall
17855,Lily told you.,Robin
17856,Told him what?,Ted
17857,Max has a small penis.,Lily
17858,How can you speak of such things?,Barney
17859,Girls talk about everything.,Robin
17860,"Size, shape, left or right leaning orientation...",Lily
17861,"Length, resemblance to a historical figure, such as Winston Churchill... Yes, that's one of you. Girth, grooming...",Robin
17862,How can you speak of such things?,Barney
17863,"You're kidding. Barney, every time I mention a woman you don't know, the first thing you say is, &quot;Boobs?&quot; Not the complete sentence, &quot;Does she have big boobs?&quot; Which also would not be great. Just: &quot;Boobs?&quot;",Lily
17864,I do not do that.,Barney
17865,My friend Lori from work...,Lily
17866,Boobs? Damn it. But... seriously. Boobs?,Barney
17867,"So why is it okay for guys to talk about boobs, but the moment we bring up a topic like Max's small penis... I'm gonna pretend this conversation never happened.",Lily
17868,Impossible. Max's penis is stuck in my brain like a splinter. Like a splinter-sized splinter.,Marshall
17869,"Speaking of disappointing weenies... Ted, tell them what you told me.",Barney
17870,I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building.,Ted
17871,"I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin... Wait a minute. Who's the girl?",Barney
17872,Duh. Of course there's a girl.,Robin
17873,What? I... There's no g-girl. Why would you even... Her name is Zoey.,Ted
17874,Boobs?,Barney
17875,"Look, mister, you are very convincing, and I am very flattered. Confused, even. But I'm not looking...",Ted
17876,"Not only is she funny, hot and genetically female, but get this...",Ted
17877,She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream!,Ted
17878,Whose dream?,Barney
17879,We wound up talking for hours.,Ted
17880,Old is always better. I can't wait to be old.,Ted
17881,You can shoplift and pretend you're just confused.,Ted
17882,"Well, I'd say you got a pretty long wait.",Ted
17883,"Oh, Ted, that's so romantic. I want to fill a pillowcase with dead batteries and b*at you with it.",Barney
17884,Anything.,Ted
17885,And you said...?,Barney
17886,Where do I sign?,Ted
17887,"Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs?",Barney
17888,This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,Ted
17889,"And what did this &quot;Zoey&quot; say when she found out that you're the one tearing down her beloved Arcadian? That you, Ted Mosby, are the Architect Of Destruction?",Barney
17890,Whoa! Sweet wrestling name alert.,Marshall
17891,"Well... Uh, it's a... it's a funny thing about that...",Ted
17892,I'm a veterinarian.,Ted
17893,What? I panicked!,Ted
17894,This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl.,Barney
17895,I don't do that.,Ted
17896,"Well, off to meet Steph. We're adrenaline junkies! [...]Penelope is taking me to the Battle of Gettysburg. We're gonna eat squirrel! [...] (<em>Ted enters the living room, dressed up as a wizard)</em> Look, she's really hot, okay?",Ted
17897,Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.,Ted
17898,Asian girls love them some Jews.,Barney
17899,And Marshall never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily.,Ted
17900,"Um, I think you got that backwards there, Chief.",Lily
17901,And you're welcome.,Marshall
17902,"The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?",Ted
17903,"No. Technically, they were eggs.",Barney
17904,Did you just say &quot;eggs&quot;?,Ted
17905,I don't recall saying &quot;eggs.&quot;,Barney
17906,"Yeah, I-I think it is so cool that you started your own law firm.",Robin
17907,"Hey, hey. I bet it's not that small.",Marshall
17908,"Yeah, but, uh, you know what they say. The important thing is-is how you use it, you know? &quot;The motion of the ocean.&quot; That whole thing.",Marshall
17909,"He said it's small, Marshall, and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on.",Robin
17910,I'm just saying that I bet it's bigger than he thinks. And thick.,Marshall
17911,Let's order!,Robin
17912,Zoey... I'm Batman. Hmm. That'd be cool.,Ted
17913,Wasn't expecting bunnies.,Ted
17914,Absolutely. Just let me run up and get my bag of vet supplies. Okay. Why would I say that?,Ted
17915,"Well, spare no expense, buddy. Dinner is on me, and-and get dessert. Maybe this molten chocolate lava cake? I just want you to be happy.",Marshall
17916,Totally.,Robin
17917,We'll just be here. <em>(He gives a hug to Max</em>)You're great.,Marshall
17918,I know.,Marshall
17919,"Damn, baby, be cool!",Lily
17920,You're acting like he has six months to live.,Robin
17921,It's your fault! You ladies and your salty sailor talk!,Marshall
17922,"Oh, come on! What about you men and your locker room talk?",Robin
17923,Locker room talk. Do you want to know what it's like in a men's locker room?,Marshall
17924,It's just a bunch of uncomfortable dudes trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. And one old guy just letting it all hang out.,Marshall
17925,Are you suggesting that guys don't talk about sex?,Lily
17926,"Yes, we do, but you know what we say? &quot;I hit that.&quot;&quot;I got some.&quot;&quot;I tapped it.&quot; &quot;I squeezed those.&quot; Discreet and efficient.",Marshall
17927,Not to mention classy.,Robin
17928,"Thank God that I'm not dating. If I thought that Lily talked in that much detail about our sex life, I'd probably k*ll myself. Oh, no. What did you tell her?",Marshall
17929,"Oh, nothing. We don't talk about you!",Lily
17930,Are you sure?,Marshall
17931,Yeah. That argument has no traction whatsoever.,Robin
17932,You just broke in and stole these guys? Aren't you worried about getting arrested?,Ted
17933,Wow. You're a little bit crazy.,Ted
17934,"Yeah. Yeah. Although I hear there's a lovely rooftop patio where folks can enjoy a nice bag lunch, so...",Ted
17935,"Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?!",Barney
17936,"Solid C-cup, perky bounce.",Ted
17937,Momentary grudging respect.,Barney
17938,"Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building.",Ted
17939,"Ted, that is never gonna happen.",Barney
17940,"Well, I can't tear down The Arcadian. I'm sorry, but I'm off the project.",Ted
17941,Hey.,Ted
17942,"Well, you really got to me the other night. I want to get involved with &quot;Save The Arcadian.&quot;",Ted
17943,"She was really hot, okay?",Ted
17944,How the hell could you do that?,Ted
17945,Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door.,Barney
17946,"The billboard, Barney.",Ted
17947,"I had to. Now that you have no sh*t with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal.",Barney
17948,You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting.,Ted
17949,"Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump!",Barney
17950,"Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?!",Ted
17951,Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail.,Barney
17952,You named the rabbit?,Ted
17953,"You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her. The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building. Dude, you can do whatever you want with it.",Barney
17954,You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want.,Ted
17955,So you're back in?,Barney
17956,Yeah.,Ted
17957,"Ugh, he thinks I like this...But it feels disgusting.",Lily
17958,"Uh, it looks disgusting.",Robin
17959,"Uh, is this working for you?",Marshall
17960,"&quot;Uh, is this working for you?&quot;",Lily
17961,"Oh, of course, because what woman doesn't like being slobbered on while some giant paws at her nether regions like Lenny from Of Mice and Men?",Robin
17962,"Oh, you're bad.",Lily
17963,More Cosmos?,Robin
17964,I can't... I can't do this! I can't stop thinking about you and Robin!,Marshall
17965,"Oh, I've had that a couple times. Just lean into it and let it fuel things.",Lily
17966,"Look, no. You know what? Why don't you just... Why don't you just call Robin, okay, and have a good laugh about it? Whoa! Traction could have prevented that.",Marshall
17967,"Well, that explains a few voicemails. Listen, Zoey, I think we can save The Arcadian. No. Maybe not in the way you were picturing, but I stayed up all night working on a new concept, all right? What if my design could incorporate The Arcadian's facade into the new GNB headquarters?",Ted
17968,Are you married?,Ted
17969,This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,Ted
17970,"Yeah, it was about the girl.",Ted
17971,"This wouldn't work. Zoey, The Arcadian was a really great building once, but it's falling apart, and it's full of snakes.",Ted
17972,I don't recall saying snakes.,Ted
17973,"Then he gets this panicked look on his face, says, &quot;I can't do this,&quot; and storms out.",Lily
17974,"Wow, that is weird.",Robin
17975,But here's the crazier part.,Lily
17976,No. You know what? Papa don't back down from a fight. So why don't you tell Robin... about this!,Marshall
17977,"It was amazing. He was passionate, animalistic, a complete stud.",Lily
17978,"Wow. So he's right there making you say all this, huh?",Robin
17979,"Yup. &quot;'You're like a Greek god, I moaned, as the...&quot; I can't read that, baby.",Lily
17980,&quot;Musky scent of man.&quot;,Marshall
17981,&quot;As the musky scent of man and Marshall's sure-footed traction intoxicated and overpowered me.&quot;,Lily
17982,That sounds real.,Robin
17983,How's it going with Robin?,Marshall
17984,Really? Why? You with her?,Marshall
17985,"Hey, what's not for everyone?",Ted
17986,"Guys, come on. What is it?",Marshall
17987,"I... What do you think it was, Murray?",Marshall
17988,"So, have you guys landed on a name yet?",Marshall
17989,"Stuart, you are so... That's not gonna be us, right? I mean, how hard can it be to name a baby?",Marshall
17990,"Right? I mean, just look at her. Yeah. She's clearly a...",Lily
17991,Emily.,Marshall
17992,Lisa.,Lily
17993,Lisa?!,Marshall
17994,Emily?!,Lily
17995,Okay! I made a list of awesome baby names. Starting at the top: number one...,Marshall
17996,"I'm gonna stop you right here, Marshall. You name a chubby white kid &quot;LeBron,&quot; and he's the one getting stuffed in the basketball hoop.",Ted
17997,"Then I'm also crossing off, um, &quot;Shaquille&quot;... Mm-hmm. &quot;Hakeem,&quot; and &quot;Dikembe.&quot; Hey, what about &quot;Rob&quot;?",Marshall
17998,&quot;Rob&quot;? No.,Lily
17999,Why not?,Marshall
18000,"Hey, Rob. What are you gonna make? A turkey?",Lily
18001,Not &quot;Rob.&quot;,Lily
18002,"um, how about &quot;Ryan&quot;?",Marshall
18003,Ooh.,Ted
18004,Not &quot;Ryan.&quot;,Lily
18005,&quot;Johnny?&quot;,Marshall
18006,"Hey, where's the goldfish?",Lily
18007,Not &quot;Johnny.&quot; Or &quot;Gil.&quot;,Lily
18008,&quot;Jeremy.&quot;,Marshall
18009,"Jeremy, no!",Lily
18010,Definitely not &quot;Jeremy.&quot; His stuff was so derivative.,Lily
18011,"Well, I mean, geez, Lily.",Marshall
18012,"Well, whatever you do, do not name your baby &quot;Becky,&quot; right?",Robin
18013,Why? What?,Marshall
18014,Becky. My new co-anchor? Don't you guys ever watch the show?,Robin
18015,"Oh, honey, I really try.",Lily
18016,Our DVR won't recognize it as a television program.,Marshall
18017,"I watched. Robin insisted I confirm how &quot;awful&quot; Becky is, so last night I checked it out.",Ted
18018,"Peace talks in the region have been described as, &quot;productive.&quot; Becky?",Robin
18019,"Becky, we're-we're journalists. We can't get emotional about the news, we...",Robin
18020,"Well, if you read the story, we might find out.",Robin
18021,"Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky?",Robin
18022,Mmm... <em>(muttering)</em> I thought she was charming.,Ted
18023,"You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men?",Robin
18024,You want the long version or the short version?,Barney
18025,Short version.,Lily
18026,Short version. Who's your daddy?,Barney
18027,"You know, when you think about that, that phrase is really creepy.",Lily
18028,"No, it's not. It's fun. Here, watch this. Hey, Lily... Who's your daddy?",Marshall
18029,"Okay, uh, let me get this straight. So, in, uh, in this scenario, because you make such sweet love to Lily, she is now your daughter.",Robin
18030,"No, she is not my daughter. I'm just her daddy.",Marshall
18031,Wow. That is disgusting.,Ted
18032,"Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy.",Robin
18033,Challenge accepted.,Barney
18034,No.,Robin
18035,"I, Barney Stinson, will pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy.",Barney
18036,Okay. Here's my list of baby names.,Lily
18037,Oh.,Marshall
18038,What about &quot;Tara&quot;?,Lily
18039,"No. Not &quot;Tara.&quot; Tara was the hottest girl in my high school. We were all, like, obsessed with her.",Marshall
18040,We didn't just talk about her and fantasize about her... We wrote songs about her.,Marshall
18041,Not &quot;Tara.&quot;,Marshall
18042,What about &quot;Esther&quot;?,Lily
18043,"Oh. Oh. Hey, Barney. That prime rib was surprisingly good, but it's 10:30 in the morning. I don't need to see a lady get naked and dance.",Marshall
18044,"Oh, Esther gets naked. But she doesn't dance.",Barney
18045,Then what does she do? Sweet mother nature!,Marshall
18046,That was my card!,Barney
18047,Not &quot;Esther.&quot; I need a drink. Ted? Ted?,Marshall
18048,"Marshall, your list is entirely boy names. You do realize there's roughly a 50% chance of you having a daughter, right?",Ted
18049,"Okay, honestly, I've never thought about having a girl. I don't want to think about having a girl. Tara, Esther -- can you imagine being one of those girls' dads?",Marshall
18050,"I have no idea how to raise a daughter! What if she makes bad choices? I mean, what if she winds up dating some... Oh, God.",Marshall
18051,I don't want a girl. I just want a little boy.,Marshall
18052,"It's not what it sounds like, folks.",Ted
18053,"Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.",Marshall
18054,"Oh, okay, um... You guys, you're a little too close to the camera. Can you back up a bit?",Marshall
18055,"Every time. Um, can you just sit in front of the computer like normal human beings? Perfect! Perfect.",Marshall
18056,"Um, to be honest, I'm getting a little freaked out about the idea of having a daughter. I know you two probably aren't the right people to talk to about this. You had all boys.",Marshall
18057,"I'm in a computer, Mom.",Marshall
18058,"Okay... No offense, Dad, but I doubt there's any scientific data to support--",Marshall
18059,Members of the G-8 convened today in Vienna to discuss plans to fight climate change by re... What?,Robin
18060,"Hey, Becky, Becky, this is our news segment, okay? Nobody cares what you did yesterday.",Robin
18061,Mike!,Robin
18062,"Okay, back to the G-8 conference. Hello? Mike, can I get in the sh*t? Fantastic.",Robin
18063,Wait-- did you go out with Ted Mosby?,Robin
18064,"In other news, later today, a Manhattan architect gets punched in the throat.",Robin
18065,Ow!,Ted
18066,"Ted, of all the women in New York, you had to go out with an eight-year-old girl?",Robin
18067,"Not what it sounds like, folks.",Ted
18068,"Ted, you know that I hate her. How could you go out on a date with this girl?",Robin
18069,It wasn't a date. She came over to the apartment looking for you.,Ted
18070,Aww...,Ted
18071,"Let me guess: she acted like a helpless little girl, and you stepped in as the big, strong man.",Robin
18072,I don't know if that's totally true.,Ted
18073,"It's okay, little darlin'.",Ted
18074,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. Spiders gotta die so trees can grow.",Ted
18075,"Then I held her tight and told her it was all gonna be okay. By the way, I think I only wounded the spider. It crawled off into my bedroom.",Ted
18076,Wait. Is that why you slept on the couch last night?,Robin
18077,"(<em>scoffing</em>) Yeah, I slept.",Ted
18078,I'm dying out here. Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies.,Barney
18079,"(<em>in childlike voice)</em> Wow, lady. You got some tig ol' bitties! Gosh! Your body's a perfect... this many. <em>(To another girl)</em> Hi. Do you want to wrestle with our special bathing suit places? Come on!",Barney
18080,"Mm, I just need two seconds, baby.",Marshall
18081,"I know you think that's a compliment, but I'd rather you took your time.",Lily
18082,"No, um... I'll be right back.",Marshall
18083,"This is ridiculous. <em>(He imagines his daughter, pregnant et in a wedding gown)</em>",Marshall
18084,"<em>(little boy voice)</em> Hey, want to have a three-way with me and my imaginary friend? His name's Otis. Hey, hey, want to come to my house and play telephone? I got the string; you got the cans. (giggles) I wet myself! Will you change me? Can't blame her on that one. Guys... I have some terrible, terrible news. I, Barney Stinson, can't pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy. Challenge forfeited.",Barney
18085,"Yeah, we don't care about this...",Robin
18086,"No one challenged you, so it wasn't really a challenge.",Ted
18087,<em>(whispers)</em> I'm sorry.,Barney
18088,Challenge accept...,Barney
18089,"Wow, I'm glad that's over. It was creepy watching Barney talk like a little kid.",Ted
18090,"Oh, but you find it irresistible when Becky does? I don't get it. The Ted that I went out with was attracted to the kind of woman who could use a steak kn*fe without supervision.",Robin
18091,"For your information, Becky doesn't like steak, she likes pasghetti. Spaghetti. And more importantly, she makes me feel needed.",Ted
18092,Needed? (scoffs) She makes training wheels feel needed.,Robin
18093,"Hey, it's nice to feel needed. And you know what? It's not a feeling guys get when they're with you.",Ted
18094,Okay. <em>(He dunks your man sack in a big old bowl of ice)</em> Mm-hmm.,Marshall
18095,Eriksen!,Marshall
18096,"When we were dating, I... I didn't make you feel needed?",Robin
18097,Come on! You always took charge of everything.,Ted
18098,I got this.,Robin
18099,Thanks.,Ted
18100,This okay? Am I hurting y...,Ted
18101,I got this. Whoa!,Robin
18102,Someone's trying to break in-- call the cops.,Ted
18103,I got this.,Robin
18104,Did that really bother you?,Robin
18105,"Well, yeah. It's nice to be needed. Look, I'm sorry. (<em>phone chimes)</em> I didn't mean to upset you. It's Becky. Aw, she's trapped in a revolving door.",Ted
18106,I got this.,Robin
18107,Yeah.,Ted
18108,<em>(goofy voice)</em> Let's make a baby!,Marshall
18109,"Whoa! Baby, you're packing snowballs, and your breath smells like a mermaid fart.",Lily
18110,"Loving the dirty talk-- but you know what's even hotter? If we face this-a-way. Ooh, we're bad.",Marshall
18111,"Wait... hey, baby, why are you facing me north? You're trying to make us have a boy.",Lily
18112,"I... can ex... How do you know about the north thing? Um, um... And what are you doing with those lemons?",Marshall
18113,You're trying to make us have a girl! You are trying to make us have a girl.,Marshall
18114,"All my least favorite students have been boys. So I Googled &quot;how to make a girl some really weird stuff came up but finally, I found this conception Web site that said you should point south at the moment of conception... eat a lemon......and heat up your lady parts to a balmy 105 degrees. <em>(blow-dryer whooshing</em>) Ooh... ah... Oh, that's not bad.",Lily
18115,"Lily, how could you do... exactly the same thing I did? You're supposed to be the sane one.",Marshall
18116,See that? Another boy expecting a woman to clean up his mistakes. That's why girls are way better than boys.,Lily
18117,"Oh, really. Well, then how come whenever there's a creepy kid in a horror movie it's always a little girl? Or twin girls, who speak... (<em>eerily</em>): in unison.",Marshall
18118,"Oh, well, what about Chucky?",Lily
18119,"Okay, A) He was a doll; B) He was possessed by an adult serial k*ll; and C) How could you bring up Chucky right before bed?",Marshall
18120,Hey.,Robin
18121,Hey.,Barney
18122,"Hey. Um, when we were dating, did... did I make you feel needed?",Robin
18123,"No, I didn't feel like you needed me at all.",Barney
18124,"That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry.",Robin
18125,"Wait, where are you... That's a compliment. You are the least needy woman I've ever met-- that's awesome. I mean, no guy's gonna say &quot;Who's your daddy?&quot; to Robin Scherbatsky. You're your own daddy. And mommy. And weird survivalist uncle who lives in a cabin with a g*n blaming stuff on the government. And that is what makes you the most... amazing, strong... independent woman I've ever banged.",Barney
18126,"Thanks, Barney. You know, um... there's something that I wanted to ask you, and I don't really know how to say it so... here goes. Who's the crazy chick in the apron?",Robin
18127,"(baby voice): Uh-oh, I'm in &quot;twubble.&quot;",Barney
18128,"Last night, after admitting defeat, I just let myself go.",Barney
18129,No! It's my ice cream; you can't have any.,Barney
18130,"Challenge completed! <em>(chuckles)</em> Now, uh, can you get this freak out of here? I'm really scared.",Barney
18131,I got this.,Robin
18132,"Oh, so you finally agreed on a name?",Lily
18133,Esther? That's beautiful.,Marshall
18134,We're idiots.,Lily
18135,"Baby, names and gender, it's just, like... it's some way of giving ourselves the illusion that we have any control whatsoever. I- I just want a healthy, happy, 12-pound--",Marshall
18136,Whoa.,Lily
18137,Ten-pound? Eight-pound?,Marshall
18138,"I guess, but, dude, you're writing checks my vagina can't cash.",Lily
18139,I love you. And I'm gonna love the crap out of whatever baby we have.,Marshall
18140,"Me, too.",Lily
18141,"You know what? We should just think of a name that's good for either a girl or a boy. Like, um...",Marshall
18142,Marshall... we just named our baby. Jamie.,Lily
18143,Not Jamie.,Lily
18144,"Shoe's untied. I got it. Yeah, this is over.",Ted
18145,"And so, due to one architectural oversight, the Toledo Bridge Disaster of 1906 claimed the lives of 75 people. Now, I hate to stop while I'm on a roll, but happy Halloween, ya crazies!",Ted
18146,"Nah, I got a thing. But you kids have fun trick or treating. This is a treat.",Ted
18147,Did it hurt?,Lily
18148,What?,Ted
18149,Getting that kid's nose surgically removed from your ass.,Lily
18150,"It's not her nose that's in my ass, Lily, it's her heart. My class loves me; I-I'm really making an impression on those guys. I'd like to make impression on those guys.",Ted
18151,"Man, I love the office Halloween party. It is so much sluttier than the office Christmas party. Though not as freaky as the office President's Day Rave. Or the office Tu B'Shvat Pajama Jammy-Jam.",Barney
18152,"Hey, Randy. Uh, you want a beer?",Marshall
18153,I wouldn't consider any part of that bragging.,Barney
18154,Robin?,Ted
18155,Robin has another party to go to.,Lily
18156,But she might stop by later.,Lily
18157,"Look at them heading home after their dirty, filthy hookups.",Marshall
18158,(shudders) Looks like that bee got busy.,Barney
18159,Looks like that French maid didn't turn down somebody's bed.,Ted
18160,"Oh, looks like Pocahontas has a couple of wounded knees.",Marshall
18161,"Come on, Marshall.",Ted
18162,That's a line.,Barney
18163,"No, it's because of the...",Marshall
18164,We get it.,Ted
18165,Does it get any better than this?,Barney
18166,"Uh, yes. (<em>Robin arrives)</em> Yes, it does.",Ted
18167,Crap.,Robin
18168,There she is Florence Night-In-Bed-With-A-Stranger.,Barney
18169,"So, who's the lucky patient?",Lily
18170,I don't want to talk about it.,Robin
18171,Please tell me you're not hooking up with one of your co-anchors again.,Ted
18172,My co-anchor's a woman.,Robin
18173,Please tell me you are hooking up with one of your co-anchors again. (laughing),Barney
18174,You did a commercial?,Robin
18175,You're a journalist! Don't you want to be taken seriously?,Robin
18176,"Okay, well, if you really think this is going to help your image.",Robin
18177,"Robin, you gotta not worry so much about being liked.",Ted
18178,"Oh, easy for you to say. Everybody loves you at your job.",Robin
18179,Hmm... Boo... freakin'... hoo.,Ted
18180,"Architecturally significant?! Zoey, you're very pretty. Your hair smells great.",Ted
18181,You don't know the first thing about architecture.,Ted
18182,"I'm a professor, okay? I teach this stuff at one of the best colleges in the country. I don't go down to your place of non-employment and lecture you about how your little protest is a misguided waste of time, except whoops, I just did. Ha-burn.",Ted
18183,"Well, I should head up.",Ted
18184,I care about our precious Earth.,Barney
18185,"Yeah. Okay, get that camera out of my face before I flip you like a cheese omelet.",Marshall
18186,All you have to do is say &quot;I care about making dreams come true.&quot;,Barney
18187,"First of all, that line makes me sound like a hooker and saying it makes me feel like a hooker, so.",Marshall
18188,Everyone is in this video. Randy's in the video.,Barney
18189,"Wait. Randy, did you send the Hermanson contracts downtown?",Marshall
18190,They never arrived at the downtown office.,Marshall
18191,You shredded them?!,Marshall
18192,That's not an expression! That has never been an expression!,Marshall
18193,I'll say this: There is no quit in that guy. You should fire him.,Barney
18194,"Okay, that, that right there. That attitude is exactly why I won't be in your video. Because GNB doesn't care. They hand out pink slips like they're hors d'oevres. Just last week, I was talking to Arthur...",Marshall
18195,"GNB treats people like they're disposable, and I will not be a part of that. Marshall Eriksen does not fire people, period.",Marshall
18196,Period.,Marshall
18197,Just tell me who you slept with!,Lily
18198,"Lily, I don't want to get into it, okay?",Robin
18199,"Aha, it's someone we know. If it was some ding dong we didn't know, you'd just give me his name.",Lily
18200,Fine. It's Bill Pepper.,Robin
18201,Bill Pepper? Mm-hmm. Kind of a coincidence there happens to be a bill and a pepper shaker here on the table. Any chance you and Bill had a three-way with Fork Napkin? It's someone we know!,Lily
18202,"So, I'm assuming you all read the chapters on the Greek Revival architecture. Any questions?",Ted
18203,What are you doing here?,Ted
18204,"Very well, then, let's get started. (clears throat) Some examples of Greek Revival architecture...",Ted
18205,No.,Ted
18206,Getting back to Greek Revival...,Ted
18207,I lost them.,Ted
18208,"Look, you're new at teaching. In my kindergarten class, I have had plenty of troublesome students. Like Johnny Marley...",Lily
18209,Johnny? Johnny!,Lily
18210,He and that little stuffed horsey raised all kinds of hell. But I have a simple method for shutting down troublemakers. You know that '98 Taurus that's always parked outside? The one with the really annoying alarm?,Lily
18211,We're familiar with it.,Ted
18212,"Well, when a kid like Johnny acts up in my class...",Lily
18213,Shuts them right up.,Lily
18214,"Lily, my students are adults, and I treat them that way. I'll just give them more candy and make them a mix CD. Problem solved.",Ted
18215,"Oh, baby, what's wrong?",Lily
18216,Something bad happened.,Marshall
18217,"Randy, hey, have you seen the...",Marshall
18218,That's the Hermanson contract?,Marshall
18219,I need the Filbert contract!,Marshall
18220,"Sorry, Randy, but... this just isn't working out.",Marshall
18221,"Marshall popped his cherry! Oh! Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster. I mean, it reflected badly on the company. He was an embarrassment. A huge embarrassment.",Barney
18222,You slept with Randy!,Lily
18223,What?!,Robin
18224,"Why, it's elementary, my dear Scherbatson.",Lily
18225,"Your co-host is getting super-popular because of her stupid commercial, &quot;Boats! Boats! Boats!&quot; So, when you arrived at the GNB party after we left, you were feeling vulnerable and drunk. Then, from across the not-so-crowded conference room, your eyes met. And as we all remember... Randy has a unique condition.",Lily
18226,"Yeah, your nose is bleeding like a faucet.",Robin
18227,That's...exactly what happened.,Robin
18228,"See, Marshall, if getting fired is an execution, at least the guy had a last meal. I promise you, tomorrow you'll feel a lot better.",Barney
18229,"Randy, hey, what's going on?",Marshall
18230,Thank you. So where you headed now?,Marshall
18231,No!!,Marshall
18232,"It's okay, baby.",Lily
18233,"Arthur, I'm here because I made a mistake. I fired Randy yesterday.",Marshall
18234,"No, sir, that is what's wrong with this company. How can we say &quot;GNB Cares,&quot; and then turn around and treat someone like that? I mean, sure, he made a few mistakes but everybody makes mistakes. Like, like Tugboat here. Aw. I bet you he's made some mistakes. And you didn't fire Tugboat, did you?",Marshall
18235,Exactly-- kind of. Randy doesn't need to be fired. He needs to be fixed.,Marshall
18236,"No, sir, I'm saying instead of getting rid of someone when they screw up, we should... we should help them. We should nurture them.",Marshall
18237,"Guys, Prof Rock is a really good mix, okay?",Ted
18238,Boo... freakin'...,Ted
18239,"The one day I miss the sack circle, you guys sub her in?",Ted
18240,No. I was returning a hot dog costume that you all enjoyed.,Ted
18241,And did it work?,Lily
18242,"Like gangbusters. We're buddies again. After class, we hacked a little sack to the thumpin' strains of my Prof Rock CD. And no, none of them had heard the Pixies B-side. Actually, none of them had heard of the Pixies. Or a B-side.",Ted
18243,"Uh-oh. I know that smile. Lily, there's no easy way to say this. Marshall's dead. Randy m*rder him.",Barney
18244,No. I know why Randy is smiling. You're smiling because of Robin.,Lily
18245,"I'm trying to eat here, buddy.",Ted
18246,No. Because you slept with her on Halloween.,Lily
18247,You didn't sleep with her?,Lily
18248,So why are you smiling?,Lily
18249,This just isn't working out.,Marshall
18250,"Randy, great news! You're not fired!",Marshall
18251,"Good morning, everybody... Where's my class?",Ted
18252,"I got you your job back, Randy. I thought that you'd be happy.",Marshall
18253,"Well, then quit. No one's stopping you.",Marshall
18254,"Well, I'm sorry Randy, but that's called fraud.",Marshall
18255,"Even if I wanted to fire you, after my talk with Arthur...",Marshall
18256,"Listen, Randy, I'm sorry, but I broke my own moral code once and I felt evil. I will not let GNB change me. I will never fire anyone again ever.",Marshall
18257,"Anyhoo, while I got you-- big smile. &quot;We care about making dreams come true,&quot; in three, two...",Barney
18258,What are you doing?,Marshall
18259,"No, it's actually, um, nice having some of this clutter off my desk. So thank you, Randy.",Marshall
18260,"I don't know what I'm going to use this for, but it's great stuff.",Marshall
18261,I've been meaning to clean out that file cabinet for ages.,Marshall
18262,"I'm not even here. Randy, the coffee.",Barney
18263,"Oh! Okay. Okay. Thank you, Randy. I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine.",Marshall
18264,"Here, try this, but really go for it. Remember, this guy ruined your life.",Barney
18265,That's just the pick-me-up I needed.,Marshall
18266,"Speaking of pickups, can we try the first one again?",Barney
18267,Hello.,Lily
18268,It didn't work. They hate me. How do I get them to like me again?,Ted
18269,"You don't. Ted, you're their teacher. The only people that like their teachers...",Lily
18270,I like my teachers.,Ted
18271,"...are dorks. Except for you, Miles. Ted, you just have to learn to embrace their hatred. Because behind that hatred lies fear. And you can use use that fear, like I did with Johnny Marley.",Lily
18272,Was there more to that story?,Ted
18273,A little bit.,Lily
18274,"Lily, you're a psychopath.",Ted
18275,"A little bit. Oh, a panda!",Lily
18276,Anyone not in class tomorrow gets an &quot;F.&quot;,Ted
18277,You said that?,Lily
18278,"Well, technically, they'd get an incomplete, but I thought &quot;F&quot; had a nice, scary ring to it. Right?",Ted
18279,Yeah.,Lily
18280,"Hey, guys.",Robin
18281,"Robin, who'd you sleep with?",Lily
18282,I told you-- Randy. He was a machine.,Robin
18283,"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
18284,"Fine. I didn't sleep with anyone. The thing is, ever since Becky did that commercial, everyone at work loves her. So, the day after Halloween, I was in a commercial.",Robin
18285,What... Why didn't you tell us?,Ted
18286,I'm going to the bathroom right now.,Robin
18287,Say... &quot;Ah...&quot;,Robin
18288,Wow! I can't wait to see it.,Ted
18289,"Well, hopefully you never will. They said that they might not even use it.",Robin
18290,You think working here is my dream?,Marshall
18291,Randy. This is delicious. You're fired.,Marshall
18292,I care about making dreams come true. You got what you need?,Marshall
18293,Yep. That's a wrap.,Barney
18294,She ruined crossword day! I can't believe this. She singles me out by name. Calls me a &quot;fat cat.&quot; Me and my &quot;fat-cat friends.&quot; We're not fat cats.,Ted
18295,"Exactly. I say, Marshall, my good man, how's my bow tie?",Barney
18296,"Impeccable, old bean. To industry!",Marshall
18297,"Ah, bully!",Barney
18298,"Look at us, huh? In tuxedos? Can you imagine if our college selves saw us like this?",Marshall
18299,They'd pelt us with their Phish bootlegs.,Ted
18300,"Yeah, we were pretty anti-establishment back then. Oh, God, remember Russell?",Marshall
18301,"Nice monkey suit, Russell.",Marshall
18302,"Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you with that corporate noose around your neck. And don't even try showing up to the drum circle this weekend.",Marshall
18303,"Oh, hey. You guys seen Russell? I'm supposed to drive him to his mom's funeral.",Ted
18304,I wish I knew you guys back then. You know why? Because you can't kick a story in the nuts.,Robin
18305,"Hey, we're still those people. One of these days, Marshall's going to quit his job and go to work for the NRDC, and save the world, right, baby?",Lily
18306,"Absotively. But let's just remember, I mean, nobody's the same as they were in college. You know, it's like, I wear a suit to work every day.",Marshall
18307,"Well, yeah, but you wear it ironically, like Ted's fanny pack.",Lily
18308,"Next time we go to Great Adventure, you're carrying your own sunblock.",Ted
18309,"Ooh! I love this exhibit. One time when I was a kid, this room was closed for cleaning, so I snuck under the rope.",Lily
18310,"Wow, that's pretty cool. When I was a kid, I knocked down the blue whale.",Barney
18311,"Okay, the giant blue whale hanging from the ceiling?",Marshall
18312,"I was six. My uncle Jerry brought me here for the day. He said, &quot;Don't touch anything&quot;. To a kid. That's like someone telling us &quot;Don't look at that girl's perky and impossibly symmetrical knockers.&quot;",Barney
18313,Not bad.,Robin
18314,"So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale. I'm surprised security didn't stop me on the way in.",Barney
18315,"Well, I'm sure they don't remember. I mean, it's been like 30 years since that completely made-up story didn't happen.",Robin
18316,It happened. And these people don't forget. This is not the Natural Stuff That Happened No More Than Five Minutes Ago Museum. Huh?,Barney
18317,The Captain?,Marshall
18318,The Captain?,Barney
18319,Ahoy.,Barney
18320,"Ahoy, The Captain.",Marshall
18321,"Thank you, The Captain.",Marshall
18322,Challenge accepted.,Barney
18323,Wow. &quot;The future of Goliath National Bank&quot;?,Lily
18324,"I know, it's so, uh... You know, I totally forgot to tell you, but, um, the other day, Arthur offered me a five-year contract.",Marshall
18325,"Oh, well, don't turn him down here in public. I broke up with Scooter at the prom. Right before the picture, too.",Lily
18326,"So whatever you do, don't tell him here tonight, 'cause...",Lily
18327,I think I'm going to say yes.,Marshall
18328,"Ah, that's the stuff.",Barney
18329,"I didn't realize you were small potatoes. And to be clear, I am referring to your testicles.",Robin
18330,Impressive. Try this on for size.,Barney
18331,You want to dance? Let's dance.,Robin
18332,I live for the dance.,Barney
18333,Get... your other hand... off my ass.,Robin
18334,"Sorry, sorry.",Barney
18335,"What do you mean, you're going to say yes?",Lily
18336,I-I want to keep working at GNB.,Marshall
18337,But I thought that you...,Lily
18338,"Guys, guys, guys? Architecture fun fact: If you stand right here, and you whisper, a person all the way across the other end of the room hears it like you're standing right next to them. It's one of the most sophisticated pieces of acoustical design in the world. Watch. (whispers): Diarrhea. Right? Right?",Ted
18339,But a five-year contract. I thought you hated GNB.,Lily
18340,"Look, I don't hate all of it. Tonight's fun. Take a look around. I mean, this is pretty high-class.",Marshall
18341,"Zoey? Well, well, well.",Ted
18342,"So, what are we protesting tonight? Rising cost of jet fuel? The government's oppressive top hat and monocle tax?",Ted
18343,"Yeah, old stuff's great.",Ted
18344,"Mmm. Ah, this Scotch is good. How's your drink?",Robin
18345,"This is ridiculous. We are two grown adults standing among the greatest collection of natural artifacts in the Western hemisphere, and look at what we're doing.",Barney
18346,You're right.,Robin
18347,Want to go touch a bunch of stuff?,Barney
18348,"Yeah, I do.",Robin
18349,"So, Captain. How'd you get that name, anyway?",Ted
18350,"Well, pleased to meet you, Captain. I'm Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville.",Ted
18351,"The boat? There's a boat? You must tell me about this boat, Captain.",Ted
18352,She!,Ted
18353,"Yes. The sea is all like, &quot;Ted, come hang out.&quot;",Ted
18354,"Man, I wish me and my dad were as close as you guys are.",Ted
18355,"No, if I wanted to make it personal, I'd call you a bored little trophy wife who likes to play activist when the shops on 5th Avenue are closed.",Ted
18356,"Down where? To the yacht club? Oh! I would love to. W-w-wait. I'm half Jewish, will that be a problem?",Ted
18357,So what about becoming an environmental lawyer? What about saving the world?,Lily
18358,"That was a great dream. But we have a mortgage, and we're trying to have kids. We're grown-ups now, Lily.",Marshall
18359,Wieners and gonads.,Ted
18360,What would College You say if he heard what you were saying right now?,Lily
18361,"Honestly? Probably something pretentious, and pseudo-intellectual, like...",Marshall
18362,Boogers.,Ted
18363,"We all change, Lily. You know, you don't spell &quot;women&quot; with a &quot;Y&quot; anymore. And I'm okay with that. And you need to be okay with the fact that I may never become an environmental lawyer.",Marshall
18364,So how long have you felt this way?,Lily
18365,Honestly? Since my first day at GNB.,Marshall
18366,Hershey squirts.,Ted
18367,"Hey. How do you like my date's tux? Ooh! Uh, a-thank you! Oh, none for him. He's stuffed.",Robin
18368,"Oh! Zoey! There you are. Oh, my God. You have a monocle. Is this real? Is this really happening?",Ted
18369,Good luck k*ll James Bond. <em>(Zoey takes Ted away)</em> Are we allowed in here?,Ted
18370,"I want my crossword day back. Okay? Go live your perfect little life, and leave me the hell alone.",Ted
18371,"Oh, please, what's your biggest problem? Having to sail back to the marina because the Captain's all out of white Zin? Oh. Great. Now you're crying. Like that's going to get my sympathy.",Ted
18372,"You've known about this for two and a half years? So every time you've talked about wanting to be an environmental lawyer since then, that was a lie.",Lily
18373,"Technically, I never lied. You asked me questions, and I responded with made-up words.",Marshall
18374,What?,Lily
18375,"So, you'll probably quit GNB in a couple years, right?",Lily
18376,Affirmatootly.,Marshall
18377,And become an environmental lawyer?,Lily
18378,Yepskerdoodles.,Marshall
18379,"Hey, by the way, do you like this scarf?",Lily
18380,Posititochadochmecochepopocha.,Marshall
18381,Lawyered.,Marshall
18382,"Okay, that's also a made-up word.",Lily
18383,"Okay. Lily, what do you want from me? I want you to be the person I fell in love with.",Marshall
18384,Niled it.,Barney
18385,Thank God you're here. She's been messing with the exhibits.,Barney
18386,He seems like a good guy. He wears those red pants.,Ted
18387,"It's not crazy at all. I'm the same way. Look, Zoey, The Arcadian should be a landmark, it should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate that we have to tear it down. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of wieners and gonads.",Ted
18388,What?,Ted
18389,You tricked me.,Ted
18390,I'm sorry. Did you say someone knocked down the blue whale?,Robin
18391,"Oh, yeah, that story is legend... (phone ringing) Hold on....dary. And, um, would you happen to know what that young man's name was?",Barney
18392,Thank you.,Barney
18393,She caught me on tape trashing GNB.,Ted
18394,Really? You'd do that to your own wife?,Ted
18395,"No, you know what? Don't erase the tape. And for what it's worth, I don't think she's throwing temper tantrums. I just think she's, you know, standing up for what she believes in. I respect that.",Ted
18396,"Who's the master, Leroy?",Barney
18397,"Uh, no, uncle. Jerome Whittaker is my uncle.",Barney
18398,Jerry's my uncle.,Barney
18399,I want you.,Lily
18400,"No. I mean, I want you as opposed to who you've become. You've changed so much.",Lily
18401,No.,Lily
18402,"Yes, but I'm okay with that.",Lily
18403,"Actually, you're way better now. You last, like, two, three times as long.",Lily
18404,"It's okay. College Lily thinks those are orgasms. No, it's... it's none of that. It's just this new Marshall... Corporate Marshall... he wears suits all the time. He doesn't care about saving the world. He's not you. I want you back.",Lily
18405,"Actually, Jane's Addiction got back together.",Lily
18406,"Yeah, they've done a few tours, they put out a new album.",Lily
18407,Sure.,Lily
18408,Hey.,Marshall
18409,Hi.,Lily
18410,"Look, Lily, I know that you would have been okay if we were poor and I was trying to save the world, but will you still be okay if I make a lot of money and I spend all of it spoiling you and our kids?",Marshall
18411,We'll make it work.,Lily
18412,So when was the last time you saw him?,Robin
18413,"It was that day... July 23, 1981. My mom got pretty mad that he let me destroy a New York City landmark.",Barney
18414,Moms.,Robin
18415,He never came around anymore after that. Think he moved away.,Barney
18416,"Well, maybe the security guy had it wrong. You never know...",Robin
18417,"But you do know, you do know. That's the thing. You know. He's my dad.",Barney
18418,"Barney, do you want...?",Robin
18419,"I don't want to do anything. Don't tell anyone about this, okay?",Barney
18420,"I'm serious. It's a great look. I think it could come back, but one question. Does it cost half as much as glasses?",Ted
18421,"Oh, I thought we were...",Ted
18422,What?,Ted
18423,Thanks.,Ted
18424,"You look gross when you cry, you know that? Some women look cute. You look like a basset hound.",Ted
18425,"Bring it on, Princess.",Ted
18426,"Oh, God, I have been craving this burger all day.",Robin
18427,Do you know what plays a huge role in helping a woman conceive? Cervical mucus.,Lily
18428,"Oh, my God, I can't wait to see this movie. I hear it's really scary.",Robin
18429,"Oh, change of plans. I thought violent images wouldn't be good for my future fetus, so instead, I rented this video of a live water birth.",Lily
18430,They don't know what it is. It just showed up on my mom's X-ray.,Robin
18431,Look at this crib.,Lily
18432,"Oh, you're wearing a flower.",Marshall
18433,Thank you.,Barney
18434,"Ah, didn't compliment. Just observed.",Marshall
18435,I know. Isn't it?,Barney
18436,Why are you wearing that?,Robin
18437,Why does Barney do anything ever?,Ted
18438,"Exactly. Science. There is an 83% correlation between the times men wear boutonnieres and the times they get laid. Think about it. Proms, weddings. Grandmas' funerals. Thanks for the redhead, Nana. The &quot;everyday boutonniere&quot; by Stinson.",Barney
18439,"And nope. I'm sorry, Barney, but no girl is going home with a guy with a flower on his chest. Unless he's a clown, and she's in the trunk of his car.",Robin
18440,Along with 50 other clowns. It's a clown car. Oh.,Marshall
18441,"Robin, did you know that boutonniere is French for &quot;bootie is near?&quot; True story. Une histoire vraie.",Barney
18442,Hmm! Did you know that Barney is French for &quot;sad little guy who works way too hard to get laid&quot;&quot;,Robin
18443,"Woman, you best check yourself.",Barney
18444,"Yeah, on the bright side, I guess suits are pretty boring without them, so...",Robin
18445,Madam... that is an insult that cannot be borne! I demand satisfaction!,Barney
18446,"What, are we gonna duel?",Robin
18447,"No. I'm going to show everyone this embarrassing video of you. It's Robin Sparkles III, y'all!",Barney
18448,I cannot wait to see what's on this DVD!,Barney
18449,"Oh, you haven't watched it yet?",Marshall
18450,"No, of course not. I wanted my first time to be with someone I cared about.",Barney
18451,"Sweet! I get that a lot. Well, once.",Marshall
18452,"Hey, Robin, do you want to go get a Korean massage on Saturday?",Lily
18453,"Oh, I'd love to. I've got this knot in my neck that's so annoying.",Robin
18454,"Yeah, I figured I should get one now because once I get pregnant, no more massages. Just so annoying.",Lily
18455,Space Teens?! Is this a porno?,Barney
18456,"No, no. Dude, dude. Sweet! It's a kids' show.",Robin
18457,"I don't know. This does have all the earmarks of p*rn. Stripper pole, bad lighting, delusional girl who thinks it's a stepping stone to mainstream success.",Ted
18458,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big old bowl of pornflakes. Whoa! And who is this exquisite keytarist I assum you're about to make sweet love to?",Barney
18459,"Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life.",Robin
18460,"Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers? Get mad at each other and wrestle, but then end up kissing in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily.",Barney
18461,"Barney, you know what? If you're going to be disgusting, we're not watching this, okay?",Robin
18462,"Yeah. Come on, Barney. It's just a cute little story about... What exactly is this about?",Lily
18463,"Oh, two average Canadian teenagers who solve crimes in space using math.",Robin
18464,That sounds ridiculous.,Marshall
18465,"Oh. Oh. I have to say, as much as I hate to agree with Barney, this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia.",Lily
18466,"Okay, guys, come on. It's a kids' show! Like Electric Company or Sesame Street or, um...",Robin
18467,You can't do that on television.,Marshall
18468,Exactly.,Robin
18469,No. You can't do that on television!,Marshall
18470,"Robin, this show is so dirty, I don't know whether to hug you or run a shower for you so you can sit there alone, crying and clenching your knees.",Ted
18471,"It's just bad camera work, okay? Wayne, our camera guy... he wasn't that great.",Robin
18472,"I don't know. I think he did a pretty good job, considering he was probably only using one hand.",Marshall
18473,"You know what? I feel bad for you Americans, that you can look at this wondrous and educational adventure through space, and see something obscene. Can you just please try to look at this with the innocence of a child?",Robin
18474,"I'm sorry. We got to ration this. It's like we're on a desert island, and this video is a really hot, naked chick, and she's got, like, seaweed on her and a seashell bra. You all feel me?",Barney
18475,"Hey, if you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her?",Lily
18476,"Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card from her every year, but we're not really friends anymore.",Robin
18477,But BFFs are forever.,Lily
18478,"Oh, come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends with their high school friends.",Marshall
18479,I'm still friends with Punchy.,Ted
18480,"Dude, he lives in Cleveland. You see him once a year, at which point, he punches you really hard in the arm and tells everyone how you dookied your pants. I know, on paper he sounds great, but you guys aren't really friends.",Marshall
18481,"Look, I may not see him a lot, but it doesn't matter. Observe.",Ted
18482,Punchy!,Ted
18483,"Yeah, you, too. If you're ever in New York.",Ted
18484,We are just two peas.,Ted
18485,I don't get it. How can you and Glitter just stop being friends? Best friends don't do that.,Lily
18486,"Well, we did, okay? And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it. I got to go.",Robin
18487,Whoa. What do you think came between Robin and Jessica?,Lily
18488,"Much like our friends, the Space Teens, I think I can solve this crime with math. Okay... Okay, here is a Christmas card that Jessica sent Robin. Lily, how old would you say that kid is?",Ted
18489,"Four years, three months.",Lily
18490,Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago. Right around the time she and Robin stopped being friends.,Ted
18491,Of course. Robin hates kids.,Marshall
18492,The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat.,Barney
18493,"Thus, if I may... When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear, Robin said, &quot;To hell with this, I'm outta hare. Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her.",Ted
18494,"That's got to be it, right, Lil? Lil?",Marshall
18495,Robin's gonna dump me!,Lily
18496,"Oh, sweetheart.",Marshall
18497,When a second uterus plumped becomes...,Ted
18498,Dude. Feel the room.,Marshall
18499,No.,Robin
18500,We've been waiting all day!,Ted
18501,Just watch it without me.,Robin
18502,Two dudes on the couch together watching p*rn? That's kind of weird.,Barney
18503,"Okay, it's not p*rn, it's a kids' show.",Robin
18504,Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse.,Ted
18505,"Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off.",Robin
18506,We...,Barney
18507,I'm serious.,Robin
18508,Our characters had pet beavers.,Robin
18509,Sure.,Ted
18510,The beaver is the official animal of Canada. It's our national mascot.,Robin
18511,It's a noble creature.,Barney
18512,"Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable!",Robin
18513,No arguments here.,Barney
18514,"Punchy, what are you doing here?",Ted
18515,"Okay, uh, uh, where are you staying?",Ted
18516,Whoa. He's staying here? You're staying here?,Robin
18517,"Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied on our couch in the form of your idiot high school friend? Unbelievable!",Robin
18518,Come on. I worry about the guy. He's had the same dead-end job at a car rental place for 15 years.,Ted
18519,Don't care.,Robin
18520,He's been stuck in Cleveland his whole life.,Ted
18521,Get a hotel.,Robin
18522,Robin... LeBron.,Ted
18523,"Okay, one night. Got to go.",Robin
18524,Where are you going? We just got here.,Lily
18525,"Oh, a Korean massage.",Robin
18526,By yourself?,Lily
18527,"Well, I figured you'd be busy, reading What to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect.",Robin
18528,"Guys, did you see that? She's going to a Korean massage without me. That's our thing. I'm telling you, she's gonna dump me, just like she dumped Glitter.",Lily
18529,"Lily, come on. We don't even know that's what happened.",Marshall
18530,"Um, hello, somebody already solved that crime using math, remember?",Ted
18531,"Look, Lily. Robin is clearly getting tired of you constantly talking about babies.",Marshall
18532,I don't.,Lily
18533,"Lily, how old am I?",Marshall
18534,384 months.,Lily
18535,"Okay. So before you Lily all over the place, maybe you should try hanging out with Robin and not talking about babies.",Marshall
18536,"Hey, Lily, what brings you to the crib?",Robin
18537,Crib...,Lily
18538,What's the matter? You look rattled.,Robin
18539,Rattled? I want to talk about babies.,Lily
18540,What?,Robin
18541,"Look, I know you don't care about this stuff, but I'm about to become a mother. And as a future mother, I'm gonna need the support...",Lily
18542,"Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet.",Robin
18543,What's that supposed to mean?,Lily
18544,"It means that a fertilized egg has not yet attached itself to the lining of your uterine wall. You see? I read your Facebook updates. God, it's like it's all you ever talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it!",Robin
18545,"Well, guess what? I've got some good news. When that baby comes, you don't have to see it. In fact, you don't have to see me. This whole friendship thing? Done.",Lily
18546,Great.,Robin
18547,Great.,Lily
18548,For crying out loud. You broke up with Robin?,Marshall
18549,"I had to. We were growing apart, and we're better off without each other.",Lily
18550,"Okay, Lily, you sound about as convincing as you did the time you &quot;accidentally&quot; shredded my Joey Buttafuoco pants.",Marshall
18551,No!,Lily
18552,"Get on the phone, call Robin and fix this.",Marshall
18553,I can't. The damage is done. Can you just hold me?,Lily
18554,"You know what? No. I don't agree with what you did, and so I refuse to comfort you, despite how adorable you are when you cry.",Marshall
18555,Okay.,Lily
18556,"Okay. Maybe just one cuddle, but then that is it.",Marshall
18557,"Yeah. You know, there's more to New York than Times Square. There's the Village, the Lower East Side, Central Park...",Ted
18558,No.,Ted
18559,"Here. You know what? Hold this, okay?",Ted
18560,"Seriously, dude, he has got to go. You need to be like, &quot;You are the weakest link. Goodbye.&quot; Punchy, the tribe has spoken. Please pack up your knives and go. Your work of art didn't work for us. Your time's up. I have to ask you to leave the mansion. You must leave the chateau. Your tour ends here. You've been chopped.",Barney
18561,"Okay, yeah. I know.",Ted
18562,"You've been evicted from the Big Brother house. Your dessert just didn't measure up. Sashay away. Give me your jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen. I'm sorry, you did not get a rose. You have been eliminated from the race. You are no longer in the running to be America's Next Top Model. You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen.",Barney
18563,That's your scrotum.,Ted
18564,"Yeah, he's gotta go.",Ted
18565,What are we doing in Madison Square Garden?,Lily
18566,"Okay, you refused to talk to Robin. So I thought that you might like to talk to... the organist for the New York Rangers. Jessica Glitter?!",Marshall
18567,How did you find Glitter?,Lily
18568,"Simple, really. I used my powers of deduction. You see, I knew Glitter used to be a keytarist, which is basically a piano, so I just made a list of all the keyboard-based occupations and then I cross-matched them...",Marshall
18569,"Yo, Glitter... Be cool.",Marshall
18570,More like ex-best friends. Just like you.,Lily
18571,"Yeah, well, Marshall and I are about to get pregnant, and I know she stopped being friends with you when you had a baby, so...",Lily
18572,What? Why?,Lily
18573,Charge!,Marshall
18574,Wow. You dumped her just because you had a baby? That's cold.,Lily
18575,"Oh, God. I gotta go. I gotta go apologize to Robin. I- I need to tell her I love her, and that she'll always be a priority.",Lily
18576,"Punchy, it's time to go back.",Ted
18577,"Uh, no. Back-Back to Cleveland.",Ted
18578,You worry about me?,Ted
18579,Punchy!,Ted
18580,"Yeah. You, too. If you're ever in New York...",Ted
18581,"Wow. She sounds pretty great, Punchy.",Ted
18582,Wow! Wow! That's... I'm-I'm really happy for you.,Ted
18583,Of course I will.,Ted
18584,"Oh, there you are. Robin, I owe you a huge apology.",Lily
18585,"No, okay? Me first. I've been pulling away from you, and I'm sorry. It's just, the last time my best friend had a baby...",Robin
18586,I know. I know all about it. It's not gonna happen with you and me. And I'm sorry I've been going crazy with this baby stuff. I know you hate babies.,Lily
18587,"Whoa. Look, I hate most babies. But your baby? I'm gonna love that kid so much. I'm gonna pick it up and everything.",Robin
18588,I'm so happy you guys made up.,Marshall
18589,"Me, too.",Ted
18590,Where do I know this song from?,Barney
18591,"Oh, my God. It's the beaver song. Okay, which one of you put this on?",Robin
18592,Wow. This is so dirty.,Barney
18593,"Come on, Barney. It's a sweet song about friendship.",Marshall
18594,"Yeah, dude, come on.",Ted
18595,"*Dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah...*",Robin
18596,"Instead of stuffing, I'm going to fill the turkey with... a slightly smaller turkey. It's called a Turturkeykey!",Ted
18597,A Turturkeykey?,Lily
18598,"Yeah, I was there for the &quot;insertion.&quot; He used shoehorns. I'll be having sides.",Robin
18599,"Your loss. All right, it's dead in here. I'm gonna call it a little early.",Ted
18600,"What? No! You can't go now. It's the night before Thanksgiving. College chicks are back in town. Their moms just made a snide comment about the weight they gained. They called her a bitch, but deep down, they know she's right. And they're about to walk through that door, where we will be waiting with some light beer and some rock hard approval. Wh-what u-up?",Barney
18601,"Yeah. You don't want to bail early, man. You could become The Blitz.",Marshall
18602,Wh... you sure? We got big plans.,Ted
18603,"Yeah. Remember how last week we fired up a sandwich, and we listened to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon while watching The Wizard of Oz?",Marshall
18604,"Well, tonight, we're doing the same thing, only with &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic's Greatest Hits and Apocalypse Now.",Ted
18605,We'll see what happens.,Marshall
18606,Completely naked!,Ted
18607,Completely naked!,Marshall
18608,And the movie was awesome.,Marshall
18609,"At the exact moment Brando first appeared, &quot;Weird Al&quot; launched right into &quot;Eat It.&quot;",Ted
18610,Free beer for everyone!,Ted
18611,Free beer for everyone!,Marshall
18612,"You know what? Ted, go ahead-- leave early to do something lame. Just don't blame us if you become... The Blitz.",Marshall
18613,"All right, first of all... there's nothing lame about brining a Turturkeykey, copyright pending. And secondly, I don't believe &quot;The Curse of The Blitz&quot; is real. (gasps)",Ted
18614,What the hell happened here?,Ted
18615,"Hey! Morning, Blitz!",Robin
18616,"Aw, man! No, no! Let's get one thing straight, okay? I am not The Blitz.",Ted
18617,"Please stop. Okay, fine.",Ted
18618,...To me.,Barney
18619,The Gentleman!,Lily
18620,Wait! Wait! Wait! What's that? What's &quot;The Gentleman&quot;?,Ted
18621,"Oh, you had to be there, Blitz. Yes.",Lily
18622,"I'm not The Blitz! (<em>Ted goes into the bathroom, he hears a person yawning and opens the bath curtain)</em> Zoey?",Ted
18623,"How could you, my best friends in the world, hang out with my mortal enemy, then let her sleep in the tub where I clean myself?!",Ted
18624,"Sorry, Ted. We can explain. After you Blitzed out last night...",Lily
18625,I'm not The Blitz!,Ted
18626,"Oh, my God... That's Zoey! That's Ted's enemy. Which means she's our enemy. Let's take this bitch down.",Lily
18627,Huh? Huh? Who's got your back? Now let's have dinner!,Lily
18628,"Finish the story, Red.",Ted
18629,"Okay, well, we all started brainstorming ways to mess with her. There were a lot of different ideas kicking around.",Lily
18630,"And then I'm just going to leave her there... buck-naked, covered in candle wax, tied to the bed.",Barney
18631,"Barney, I know that Ted doesn't like that girl, but that's a little extreme.",Marshall
18632,Wait... Ted doesn't like that girl?,Barney
18633,"Okay. Wh...? Well, I got it. You see that silk scarf? I'm going to steal it.",Lily
18634,"Yeah. Yeah! My name is Lily Aldrin. I'm a friend of Ted Mosby's, so you better...",Lily
18635,"Well, yeah.",Lily
18636,<em>(gasps)</em> That was you?!,Lily
18637,Oh! Thanks!,Lily
18638,"Look, none of us meant for it to happen, but, well, we had an awesome night with her.",Robin
18639,"And then, the craziest thing happened.",Lily
18640,I missed a skateboarding dog?,Ted
18641,"Yeah, but that wasn't the crazy part.",Lily
18642,It wasn't?,Ted
18643,"Okay, awesome. Well, Lily doesn't let me do truths. So, dare.",Marshall
18644,Best idea ever!,Marshall
18645,"Worst idea ever! My junk ended up in some stranger's pocket. If there phone was on vibrate, I basically dry-humped them.",Marshall
18646,"Wait. Blitz was there, too?",Ted
18647,"It was legen-- wait for Ted to leave, 'cause he's now The Blitz-- -- dary. Legendary!",Barney
18648,I'm not The Blitz!,Ted
18649,"I'm afraid you are, Ted. You see, when you left last night, you changed the course of Blitztory.",Marshall
18650,"Well, not anymore, Blitz.",Barney
18651,"What? No! N- n-n-n-no! N-n-no! I'm not The Blitz! The only thing I missed last night was my best friends stabbing me in the back by hanging out with my worst enemy. Guys! I hate Zoey! That means you're supposed to hate her, too! Th-that's your rule, Lily!",Ted
18652,I tried.,Lily
18653,"Tried?! Lily, do you have any idea how many people I've blindly hated for you? I hated RenÃ©e Zellweger with a burning passion for eight years, only to discover you meant Reese Witherspoon!",Ted
18654,"Hey, I will hate her until I get my money back for You, Me and Dupree!",Lily
18655,That's Kate Hudson!,Ted
18656,"Oh, yeah. That's who I hate. Guys, we hate Kate Hudson.",Lily
18657,"No, we hate Zoey! I'm so furious at you all right now, but it's Thanksgiving, and I have a Turturkeykey to make. And not that I'm The Blitz, but could everyone please come with me into the kitchen? <em>(all murmuring)</em> Okay, I'm, uh, just gonna preheat the oven.",Ted
18658,The oven.,Robin
18659,"Hey, Robin, you should dance on the oven.",Barney
18660,"Great. So not only did you guys betray me, but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving?",Ted
18661,"Full disclosure. We also used all your butter, greasing up Lily so we could see how far we could slide her down the hall.",Barney
18662,"But if it helps, I reached 4G.",Lily
18663,It doesn't help. 4G? No. What-What are we supposed to do now?,Ted
18664,"Barney, I don't know if the oven is deep enough. Plus, it's a display made of cardboard.",Ted
18665,Huh. I should probably disconnect the gas.,Barney
18666,"Hey, just so you guys know, there was a tiny expl*si*n at the sewage treatment plant across the street from our apartment, but I'm sure it's fine by now.",Marshall
18667,It's not awesome!,Ted
18668,I think the smaller turkey just tried to crawl further inside the bigger turkey.,Robin
18669,Um... Um... I'm have... I'm having trouble breathing!,Barney
18670,"Ted, you're not gonna like this, but we do have one other option.",Lily
18671,Could we bring Ted?,Lily
18672,No. Absolutely not.,Ted
18673,Come on. Give her a chance.,Lily
18674,"Ted, you violated a dead turkey with another dead turkey. Don't let that be in vain.",Robin
18675,Guys? Wait a minute. Where's Barney?,Marshall
18676,"And here's the twist, Babaka. Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz.",Barney
18677,No. I c... Because... Step on it.,Barney
18678,You missed it.,Marshall
18679,Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike and he sang &quot;Twist and Shout!&quot;,Robin
18680,But he's The Blitz.,Barney
18681,No. I'm not The Blitz. I'm The Bueller. You know what this means. You're The Blitz.,Ted
18682,"Oh, God, no!",Barney
18683,"Life moves pretty fast, Barney. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it.",Marshall
18684,Chicka-chicka!,Ted
18685,Zoey.,Ted
18686,Best friend alert!,Lily
18687,"Okay, the Turturkeykey is officially cooking.",Ted
18688,"Oh, God, that is disgusting!",Marshall
18689,"Okay, guys, that's starting to hurt.",Ted
18690,"No... no, Ted. Random number guy just sent me his wang back.",Marshall
18691,"Wow. You sent a wang out, and you got a wang back.",Robin
18692,It's a boom-a-wang.,Lily
18693,Nice.,Robin
18694,Thank you.,Lily
18695,"No, I meant the wang.",Robin
18696,Sure. But... no one move while I'm gone. (whispering): I'm scared.,Barney
18697,Thanks. You're the only one who's nice to me about this.,Barney
18698,What happened?,Barney
18699,You missed it!,Lily
18700,"Dude, you walked out of the room, the laws of physics stopped and the laws of awesome tripled.",Marshall
18701,"Aw, man! You said I could leave the room!",Barney
18702,"No! Y-You... Robin, Robin. I will pay you to be The Blitz. $100! No-- $10,000. No-- 60 bucks. That's a lot of money for someone like you.",Barney
18703,"Dude, The Blitz isn't something that can be bought or sold.",Marshall
18704,"Oh, what was that? I was distracted by the four-caret diamond your 53-year-old husband bought you.",Ted
18705,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a turturkeykey to baste.",Ted
18706,No... I baste alone.,Ted
18707,Who canceled? Your coven?,Ted
18708,Are you happy? You're ruining Thanksgiving.,Ted
18709,"Oh... I'm sorry, Lily. I'm just never going to like that woman.",Ted
18710,"Ted, give her a chance.",Lily
18711,Enemies can't become friends.,Ted
18712,"No, no, no. You guys can't be objective. You still feel guilty about last night.",Ted
18713,"Well, let's get an outside opinion.",Robin
18714,Who are we gonna...,Ted
18715,&quot;Dear Wang Guy...Can enemies ever be friends? Just wondering.&quot;,Robin
18716,Really? Wang Guy? We're asking Wang Guy?,Ted
18717,"He's bold and uninhibited, so why not? And guys, you know what? For fun, why don't we ask him what he does for a living? Wouldn't that be fun? Just ask...",Robin
18718,"Aww. You've got a little crush on Wang Guy, don't you?",Lily
18719,What? No. Shut up. I hate him.,Robin
18720,"Oh, look. We got an answer. Here it is. &quot;Yes, enemies can become friends. &quot;Remember what Gandhi said. 'Be the change you want to see in the world.'&quot;",Marshall
18721,I'm not any Blitz! You're The Blitz! You're all The Blitz! I slept with that cute Indian girl who cuts my hair!,Barney
18722,What does that have to do with anything?,Robin
18723,Nothing! I just forgot to brag about it before!,Barney
18724,"Guys, despite the wit and wisdom of Wang Guy, Zoey and I are never going to be friends. We're just here for her oven and that's it.",Ted
18725,"Oh, my God!",Ted
18726,What? No. It was an accident.,Ted
18727,"Oh, great. Real mature.",Ted
18728,"Just stop it! God, can't you two just stop fighting for one day? Like, when the Roadrunner and the Coyote clocked out and had a beer together? Or-Or-Or Tom and Jerry shared a cup of coffee.",Lily
18729,"Lily, those are cartoon characters, and I'm pretty sure you're making up episodes. And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!",Ted
18730,But it's Thanksgiving.,Lily
18731,Wait... Where's Barney?,Marshall
18732,"Hey, guys, the most amazing thing just happened to me in that other roo... Aw, man.",Barney
18733,I don't get it. Why'd she just kick us out like that?,Lily
18734,I guess we're going home.,Ted
18735,"Lily, where'd you get that?",Ted
18736,"Oh. When Zoey booted us, it made me want to steal something of hers again. Apartment full of designer labels, and what do I grab? &quot;Happy Turkey Day, Hannah. Love, Zoey.&quot; I wonder who Hannah is.",Lily
18737,"And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!",Ted
18738,We have to go back to Zoey's.,Ted
18739,Barney let us in.,Ted
18740,"Aw, man! Wait. Which half?",Barney
18741,"Look, I'm sorry your stepdaughter didn't want to spend Thanksgiving with you.",Ted
18742,I just do. It must be tough.,Ted
18743,"I get that. Uh, you should hang on to this. You can give it to her next year.",Ted
18744,"Hey, you never know. People don't stay enemies forever.",Ted
18745,"Ooh. Oh. Great idea. All right. Okay. Here we go. One, two, three.",Marshall
18746,Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes as good as it looks.,Ted
18747,What happened? I saw it!,Barney
18748,"Thank you, God!",Barney
18749,Okay. That man is terrifying.,Marshall
18750,"Everything he said was nice, but I am profoundly scared.",Barney
18751,Keep smiling. He can still see us.,Ted
18752,I figured it out! I know what's so creepy about The Captain.,Marshall
18753,Okay.,Robin
18754,"Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey.Observe. The bottom half of his face... is smiling. He seems happy. Seems like a nice guy. <em>(everyone is murmuring happily)</em> But the top half of his face...wants to m*rder you! Cheerful. Wants to m*rder you. No. Cheerful. Wants to m*rder you. Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question. Captain, what do you think of ice cream? Oh, he loves it!",Marshall
18755,"Captain, what do you think of rainy days?",Barney
18756,"Whoa, he hates them.",Marshall
18757,"Captain, quick question: How do you feel about the Jonas Brothers? Ooh.",Robin
18758,Ooh. What-What is that?,Ted
18759,He hates that he loves them.,Marshall
18760,"Great. Okay. Hey, guys, Zoey just told me about this great Frank Lloyd Wright retrospective tonight. Who's in?",Ted
18761,"Sorry, I'm, uh, I... I- I don't know, washing my hair.",Lily
18762,Running the water.,Marshall
18763,Holding the towel.,Robin
18764,And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited meto the big hair washing party.,Barney
18765,"All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.",Ted
18766,"Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one...",Lily
18767,Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude.,Barney
18768,Rule number one: don't go anywhere that has candles.,Lily
18769,"Excuse me, Captain, how do you feel about Ted and Zoey having an intimate chat by candlelight? It'll be the last dinner they ever have.",Marshall
18770,"Rule number two: No sharing food. In fact, anything involving saliva is off-limits. Toothbrushes, thermometers, lipstick.",Lily
18771,"Well, if I can't share her lipstick,there's really no pointin even going.",Ted
18772,And the most important rule of all...,Lily
18773,Lubricant is public property. (Robin groans),Barney
18774,Please.,Marshall
18775,No lying to the spouse about anything you do.,Lily
18776,"Why would anyone lie? Look, Zoey and I are just friends. If there was anything more than that, I wouldn't hang out with her.",Ted
18777,"Lily's right, Ted. Once you're married, it's very hard to be friends with a single person of the opposite sex.",Marshall
18778,"Yeah. Unless you're old friends, which is why I can hang out with Marshall whenever I want. Right, Marsh Madness?",Robin
18779,"No doubt, Robo Cop.",Marshall
18780,You two never hang out alone. You just made up those nicknames right now.,Lily
18781,I guess it's true. You and I never really hang out alone.,Marshall
18782,"Well, let's. Let's have dinner together, just the two of us.",Robin
18783,Oh! Sweet. No candles.,Lily
18784,"Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. Want to hang?",Barney
18785,Nah.,Lily
18786,You're a big... stupid octopus head!,Lily
18787,"Well, Lily, you were right. Something weird happened with Zoey last night.",Ted
18788,Friends. Plural. Like-Like there was more than one of me.,Ted
18789,"Ew! Ew! She lied to her husband? Uh-oh. So, what did you do?",Lily
18790,"Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say you were out with friends?",Ted
18791,It's totally okay.,Ted
18792,"It's not okay! I didn't really think it was okay! Pur-leez! You lie to your husband all the time. &quot;Uh, uh, that shirt looks great on you&quot;&quot;I love your mom&quot;&quot;I never fantasize about Barney when we're doing it&quot;&quot; Sound familiar, Pinocchio?",Lily
18793,What's wrong with this shirt?,Marshall
18794,"Lily, ruling. Do I have to stop hanging out with Zoey?",Ted
18795,"No, you just need to spend time with her and The Captain together. If you're friends with the both of them, then there's not a problem.",Lily
18796,"Actually, I do have a standing invitation from The Captain to go for a ride with them on his boat.",Ted
18797,"Great. So go make nice with Captain Creepy, and problem solved.",Lily
18798,December chill... so great.,Robin
18799,Totally.,Marshall
18800,Did you catch the game last night?,Marshall
18801,Yeah. Nail-biter.,Robin
18802,You know what's fun? Is cold weather sports.,Marshall
18803,They are fun.,Robin
18804,"Man, this is awkward.",Robin
18805,"She's giving me nothing! He's just staring at me! She's just staring at me! It's making me nervous. Great, now my left eye is twitching.",Marshall
18806,"Marshall, it's cool. She doesn't see it. What the hell's going on with his eye? Am I supposed to not talk about that? Great, now my right eye is doing it.",Robin
18807,Lots of drinks.,Marshall
18808,"Oh, so many drinks.",Robin
18809,Barney.,Lily
18810,"Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for... something, and for that other thing.",Barney
18811,"Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But let's be honest. You've been super sensitive lately.",Lily
18812,Watch out!,Lily
18813,Watch out!,Lily
18814,"Oh! Wow. Thanks, Lily. You saved me. You saved us. Look, I know you didn't mean whatever it was you said that made me so mad.",Barney
18815,I think I probably didn't.,Lily
18816,Wait. I still can't resist getting one last sh*t in.,Lily
18817,"Hi, Captain. The Captain. Captain.",Ted
18818,"Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey?",Ted
18819,"Or we could stay on dry land, hang out with some... witnesses.",Ted
18820,"You know, I had this really boring poetry class in college.",Robin
18821,You were just thinking that this dinner is really boring. That's what made you think of your boring class in college.,Marshall
18822,"What?! What? No! No! No, no, no. Marshall, no. No. I... I just saw that board of specials, and I thought, you know what sucks? Being bored. Which I am not. So that clears that... right up.",Robin
18823,"Robin, I'm an attorney.",Marshall
18824,Fine. This night's a little awkward.,Robin
18825,I guess it's 'cause we never hang out alone together.,Marshall
18826,Why is that?,Robin
18827,It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory.,Marshall
18828,"Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB.",Marshall
18829,"So, who's the eye broccoli?",Barney
18830,"Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good.",Marshall
18831,"Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs.",Barney
18832,I don't think that's gonna be a problem.,Marshall
18833,"Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be?",Barney
18834,I'm sorry. Myth?,Marshall
18835,"It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like... beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now.",Barney
18836,"And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually...",Marshall
18837,D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks.,Barney
18838,Did we bet on this?,Marshall
18839,Let's say yes.,Barney
18840,And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes.,Robin
18841,"As Lily's best friend, you are the last person on the planet o's allowed to turn into a mermaid.",Marshall
18842,"Wait, does that mean that I'm a manatee right now?",Robin
18843,Big-time manatee.,Marshall
18844,What were those sailors thinking?,Robin
18845,Huh. I don't know. Being out at sea can do crazy things to a man.,Marshall
18846,"He's gonna k*ll me. Okay, calm down, Teddy. He's not jealous. He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.",Ted
18847,"Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there.",Lily
18848,"What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face!",Barney
18849,Want to hang?,Lily
18850,Nah. Watch out!,Barney
18851,"Wow... thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us.",Lily
18852,"If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!",Lily
18853,"Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",Barney
18854,You're a jerk.,Lily
18855,"Just gonna make a quick call. Hey, silly question. What are our exact nautical coordinates?",Ted
18856,Head?,Ted
18857,"Well, I got a big morning, so... Dry cleaners, bank, you know, so...",Ted
18858,": Okay, you got to swim for it, Mosby. Man versus sea. You can do this. You didn't get a &quot;Good Effort&quot; ribbon from the Shaker Heights JCC Swim Camp because you don't have what it takes.",Ted
18859,"you're afraid that if you spend too much time alone with me, I'll turn into a mermaid?",Robin
18860,"Yes. I mean, sure, right now, you're bald and leathery ancovered in a thick layer of blubber...",Marshall
18861,Am I blushing or...?,Robin
18862,"...but at some point, my stupid male brain will transform you into a foxy fish-babe singin' &quot;Part of Your World&quot; to my pants.",Marshall
18863,"Okay, even if that happens, is there any way to un-mermaid me?",Robin
18864,I asked Barney the same thing.,Marshall
18865,"Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome.",Barney
18866,Death?,Marshall
18867,"Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City... where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty.",Barney
18868,Pregnancy?,Robin
18869,"Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant, she becomes a manatee again. Never thought I'd say that sentence.",Marshall
18870,"Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang?",Barney
18871,"High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee.",Barney
18872,"Well, you're a big... stupid octopus face!",Lily
18873,"Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman &quot;fat&quot; right to her face!",Lily
18874,"I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",Barney
18875,Oh... You're a jerk.,Lily
18876,"Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act.",Barney
18877,What's that?,Lily
18878,Breast-feeding. Hot.,Barney
18879,Really?,Lily
18880,Really. When those things swell up to three times their normal size... so do I.,Barney
18881,That's so sweet!,Lily
18882,"Okay, now we're even!",Ted
18883,Well... ish.,Ted
18884,See? It's stuff like that. Why-why do you talk that way?,Ted
18885,We can. We can be buddies. Just not on a boat.,Ted
18886,"Yeah, me, too.",Marshall
18887,"No... No, no! No! No, don't turn!",Marshall
18888,"Uh-oh. I don't feel so good. (She vomits) Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry! Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting.",Robin
18889,I really do.,Marshall
18890,Hey. You feeling better?,Ted
18891,You weren't?,Ted
18892,"I get it. And you were right. He's a nice guy. I mean, he can be a little scary.",Ted
18893,"Yeah, he's a creepy dude. But I like him. And I just want to make sure you and I hanging out doesn't, you know, cross any lines.",Ted
18894,"I mean, if either one of us had even the slightest hint of feelings for the other, we shouldn't hang out. You don't, do you?",Ted
18895,No.,Ted
18896,This is taking forever. Are you sure you did it right?,Marshall
18897,Is there a wrong way to pee on a stick?,Lily
18898,"Hey, can I ask you a question that's plagued me for years? Can girls aim?",Marshall
18899,"Um, can boys aim? 'Cause it seems to me like I'm taking a mop to that bathroom floor every two days.",Lily
18900,"Okay, you're the one who put the <em>Far Side</em> calendar up over the toilet. You know I laugh with my whole body.",Marshall
18901,It's been two minutes.,Lily
18902,It's positive.,Lily
18903,It's positive? It's positive.,Marshall
18904,I'm pregnant.,Lily
18905,What?!,Robin
18906,I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry. Force of habit. Congratulations!,Barney
18907,To Lily and Marshall.,Robin
18908,"Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier. Can't imagine anything bringing me down right now.",Marshall
18909,"Well, that did it.",Marshall
18910,Are you sure you did it right?,Marshall
18911,"Hey, Punchy, I've given this some serious thought. I think I know how we can crush these floral arrangements.",Ted
18912,"Peonies, lavender blossoms with a halo of baby's breath for an ambiance of springtime rejuvenation.",Ted
18913,It's gonna be a magical day. (<em>Ted hangs up</em>) I know what you're thinking. I wish I was a dude.,Ted
18914,I do wish you were a dude.,Robin
18915,"Because if I was a dude, I could have Ted Mosby as my best man.",Ted
18916,"No, and here's why.,Ted, the best man's job is not to crush the floral arrangements. It's to get the groom down the aisle, because, no matter who he is, he will freak out. And I just don't think you have what it takes to get that get that soldier to pick up his r*fle and charge up the hill.",Robin
18917,"Uh, are you forgetting I've done this before? I was Marshall's best man.",Ted
18918,And how did that go again? Oh for one.,Robin
18919,"Oh, come on. That wasn't my fault. And need I remind you, I gave a beautiful toast.",Ted
18920,"Ted. (Both yelling) Oh, do you take one to be your lawfully wedded wife? Oh, God, I'm freaking out. Why did I chose Ted to be my best man?",Robin
18921,"Uh, yeah. It's hard to take criticism from someone who just recorded seven episodes of <em>Million Dollar Heads or Tails.</em>",Ted
18922,Why this sudden obsession with <em>Heads or Tails</em>?,Ted
18923,"Well, it turns out that <em>Heads or Tails</em> has a job opening.",Robin
18924,"So now, because of that incident, <em>Heads or Tails</em> is looking for a new currency rotation specialist.",Robin
18925,You mean coin flip bimbo?,Ted
18926,They're not bimbos!,Robin
18927,"You auditioned, didn't you?",Ted
18928,You're the new coin flip bimbo?,Ted
18929,Currency rotation specialist.,Robin
18930,"Robin, you better check yourself before you trebek yourself. You're a journalist! What is the matter with you?",Ted
18931,"Well, it's a national audience! I get to wear shiny dresses!",Robin
18932,"Robin, have you forgotten about your New Year's resolution?",Ted
18933,I am never drinking again.,Robin
18934,"No, before that.",Ted
18935,"Before that, too.",Ted
18936,"I moved here to work for a big-time cable news channel like World Wide News. Mm-hmm. Well, by this time next year, I will be wearing a World Wide News I.D. badge around my neck. And to show you that I'm serious, this is my first and only drink of the night. Okay. Okay? Oh, damn, that's smooth.",Robin
18937,I thought you finally got that interview at World Wide News.,Ted
18938,"Well, I did, but they only offered me a boring, low-paid, off-camera research job.",Robin
18939,Which could be a stepping stone to bigger things in your career.,Ted
18940,"Well, so could <em>Heads or Tails</em>. <em>(snorts)</em> The first currency rotation specialist went on to be a semi-finalist on <em>The Bachelor</em>, and then, she lost, like, a hundred pounds on <em>The Biggest Loser</em>, and now she's totally winning <em>Celebrity Rehab</em>.",Robin
18941,I'm pregnant.,Lily
18942,What?!,Robin
18943,"Oh, my God! They're really having a baby. What am I doing with my life? Starting Monday, I'm a currency rotation spe... Oh, who am I kidding? I'm a coin flip bimbo, and I'm still single. Okay, let's not go there, Scherbatsky. That's a whole other thing. I've got to take that World Wide News job.",Robin
18944,"Well, you are looking at the new associate researcher at World Wide News.",Robin
18945,"Oh, my gosh. That's amazing news.",Marshall
18946,What changed your mind?,Ted
18947,"Marshall and Lily. I just realized that I am about to have a little niece who looks up to me. And I don't want to be sad aunt Robin, the aging coin flip bimbo who gives her the creeps. I want to be cool aunt Robin, the respected journalist... (<em>quietly)</em> Who gives her beer.",Robin
18948,What?,Lily
18949,What? Oh. I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall.,Robin
18950,"Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier.",Marshall
18951,"Hi, Mr. Trebek. This is Robin Scherbatsky.",Robin
18952,"As honored as I am by the offer, um... (<em>Phone chirps</em>) Oh, my God. They're not having a baby. What am I getting all up in my head about? That research job sounds hard. And I'm pretty. I'm really, really pretty.",Robin
18953,You are looking at the new coin flip bimbo.,Robin
18954,You took the <em>Heads or tails</em> job?,Ted
18955,Yeah.,Robin
18956,"What about World Wide News, your I.D. badge? You made a New Year's resolution.",Ted
18957,"Okay, I also said I would never make out with a garbage man. Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. What's with the gingerbread house?",Robin
18958,We're seeing a Christmas movie. It's a Christmas-themed movie snack.,Ted
18959,"Let's hope Santa brings you a girlfriend this year, Teddy.",Robin

18961,And now she's totally winning <em>Celebrity Rehab</em>.,Robin
18962,"Hey, guys. A yuletide riddle. What is my second favorite word that begins with b-o-n?",Barney
18963,Bon Jovi?,Ted
18964,"Yeah. What is my third favorite word that begins with b-o-n? <em>(Imitates buzzer)</em> Bonus. As in, my end-of-the-year bonus check.",Barney
18965,"My God, Barney! I work for GNB, too. All I got was $15 gift card to Costa Coffee.",Ted
18966,"And you earned it, buddy. Check out what I'm gonna buy for myself. The dibiase. See those pinstripes? Diamonds. It is the uppest a person could ever suit.",Barney
18967,"Uh, has it ever occurred to you to give some of this to charity?",Ted
18968,"Charity? You're seriously talking to me about charity? Dude, I am Mr. Charity. I frequently sleep with sixes, chubsters, over-thirties... I am the bill and Melinda gates of the sympathy bang.",Barney
18969,"Hey, guys. Big announcement.",Marshall
18970,"Let me guess. You got a huge bonus check, too.",Ted
18971,"No, just a $30 gift card to Costa Coffee.",Marshall
18972,Thirty?!,Ted
18973,I'm pregnant.,Lily
18974,What?!,Robin
18975,"What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!",Barney
18976,Huh. Marshall and Lily are doing something meaningful. And it's making me less happy about this bonus. And I'm still single. At least I got that going for me. So why do I still feel outside of awesome looking in? What am I doing with my life?,Barney
18977,we've never been happier. can't imagine bringing e down right now.,Marshall
18978,"Oh, Marshall, you only think you're happy. Just wait, because tonight, (<em>imitating Oprah</em>) is Barney's Favorite Things!",Barney
18979,Huh? I don't know what that is.,Marshall
18980,"Barney's Favorite Things! I'm gonna give you all a bunch of free stuff... like Oprah. Just get excited, okay?",Barney
18981,Velour track suits!,Barney
18982,Velour is so comfortable. They're so soft.,Marshall
18983,"Remote control helicopters! Condoms! And last but not least... There is a fleet of limos outside waiting to take us to... A strip club! (<em>Applause, cheering)</em> You get a lap dance! You get a lap dance! You're gonna give me a lap dance! Everybody gets a lap dance! That was amazing! It was like a diamond suit for my soul. I gotta keep going. I gotta do more.",Barney
18984,No. No! I cannot go back to that strip club. I seen some things.,Ted
18985,I'm not going back either. I'm taking the rest of my bonus to God's strip club.,Barney
18986,"Sam. Uh, father. I-I don't mean father father. Unless...",Barney
18987,I'm thinking about giving some money to charity.,Barney
18988,"No, I don't mean that charity. That charity is doing peachy. You'll see pics of the two of them in next week's e-mail.",Barney
18989,"I-I recently started giving, and it felt surprisingly good. I want to do more.",Barney
18990,"Well, I would love to help by writing a check for... one, zero, zero, zero...",Barney
18991,"...Zero... (<em>Cell phone chimes</em>) Woops. Hold on a second. Wait. They're not doing something meaningful with their lives. Well, this changes everything. Oh, no, I've already written four zeroes. Thank you, decimal point. One hundred dollars.",Barney
18992,"Diamond suited up. Hey, Ted, can you spot me for the movie? I don't like to carry a lot of cash on me.",Barney
18993,What happened to giving the money away?,Ted
18994,"Yeah, that was back when Lily was pregnant. Now she's not. Ergo, a suit is born. (<em>Chuckles)</em> Dude, what's up with the gingerbread house? You look ridiculous!",Barney
18995,It's a Christmas-themed movie snack!,Ted
18996,"Ah, I know that move. You cut a hole in the floor, she reaches into the living room, finds the tree... Nice.",Barney
18997,Where the hell are Marshall and Lily?,Ted
18998,I'm pregnant.,Lily
18999,What?!,Robin
19000,"What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!",Barney
19001,"This is great. I'm happy. I'm so happy, my heart's pounding. And I'm sweating. And I can't breathe. This is what happiness feels like, right? Oh, crap. Lily's having a baby and I'm having a panic attack. I hope she can't tell what I'm thinking right now.",Marshall
19002,"I can. And I'm freaking out, too! There's an alien growing in my stomach that's gonna explode out of my vagina!",Lily
19003,Do you think the others can tell we're freaking out?,Marshall
19004,What am I doing with my life?,Robin
19005,What am I doing with my life?,Barney
19006,I should get a Christmas-themed movie snack for tomorrow night.,Ted
19007,They're totally onto us. What do we do?,Marshall
19008,"Just keep smiling, maybe wave. No, don't wave! That makes no sense!",Lily
19009,I'm committed. I'm riding this wave straight to hell.,Marshall
19010,"Let's leave, then the waving will make sense.",Lily
19011,"Lily, we have to relax. There's no need to panic. True, there's a lot to do, but we've got nine months to prepare. So I say that we just make a list of everything that needs to get done before the baby arrives and do everything on that list tonight!",Marshall
19012,"Let's do it! Uh-huh, got it. Okay, that seems easy.",Lily
19013,Nursery's painted!,Marshall
19014,Blue? What if it's a girl?,Lily
19015,Damn it!,Marshall
19016,"Oh, God, it's 8:00! We're supposed to meet the gang at the bar to celebrate.",Lily
19017,"Oh, God. Okay, listen. When we meet them, we have to keep it together. Can you keep it together?!",Marshall
19018,"No, I can't keep it together!",Lily
19019,I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall.,Robin
19020,"Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier.",Marshall
19021,This is a nightmare! We've done everything wrong!,Marshall
19022,The iPod was on shuffle! <em>(Rock music stops</em>) The Jerky Boys! Our baby heard the Jerky Boys!,Lily
19023,"You know what, the Jerky Boys are funny.",Marshall
19024,"The Jerky Boys aren't funny, they are awful.",Lily
19025,"You know what, fine, if you don't think the Jerky Boys are funny, then I'm not sure that I can raise a child with you, liver lips.",Marshall
19026,"Marshall, I don't like this.",Lily
19027,"I know. Okay? I don't like it either. It's like I have a hot, burning ball of stress in my chest, and nothing will make it go away!",Marshall
19028,"Well, that did it.",Marshall
19029,Yeah. Huge bummer.,Marshall
19030,So disappointing.,Lily
19031,Are you guys okay?,Ted
19032,"Huh? Yeah. Why wouldn't we be? Oh, the baby thing.",Lily
19033,"Oh, yeah, whatever. Oh, Christmas-themed movie snack. Nice.",Marshall
19034,Don't reach into the living room!,Lily
19035,"Wow, I-I thought you guys would be devastated.",Ted
19036,"Oh. You know, we're actually kind of relieved. We were freaking out for about a day and a half there.",Marshall
19037,"Yeah, this whole thing got us thinking. Maybe we're not ready for kids yet after all.",Lily
19038,"Yeah, we were thinking maybe we would just get a dog.",Marshall
19039,Get a puppy!,Barney
19040,Can you imagine... That would be the cutest thing!,Marshall
19041,Oh. Our movie snack.,Barney
19042,"Are you kidding me?! All you ever talk about is having kids! And now you have one little freak-out and you want to get a dog instead?! No. Unacceptable! You're gonna turn around, you're gonna go home, get naked, lie together as man and wife until Lily is great with child. Right now! I'm serious! Go, go, go!",Ted
19043,"And you! Ooh. Barney, you look real stupid in that suit. You're gonna go get your money back and give it to charity. And I don't mean that stripper you keep e-mailing us about, even though we beg you to take us off that list.",Ted
19044,"I can't give this suit back. Ted, I glow in the dark. I finally glow in the dark!",Barney
19045,Criminals of New York! Attention! This man is wearing a diamond-covered suit! You could retire on the pants alone! Merry Christmas!,Ted
19046,"And you... You did not move to the greatest city on earth to become a coin-flipping bimbo. So here's how it's gonna work: Heads, you take the job at World Wide News; Tails, you take the job at World Wide News. Ow! Hey, looks like somebody got a new gig!",Ted
19047,"Fine, I'll call them tomorrow. I'll call them right now.",Robin
19048,Hello.,Ted
19049,"Yes, you can! You love her!",Ted
19050,"One for <em>It's a Wonderful Life</em>, please. Thank you.",Ted
19051,We're idiots.,Marshall
19052,This kid doesn't stand a chance.,Lily
19053,We're ready for this.,Marshall
19054,We're ready for this.,Lily
19055,Nope.,Barney
19056,You sure?,Marshall
19057,Positive.,Lily
19058,And there's more. Do you still do that thing where you give people in need clothes for job interviews?,Barney
19059,"Bring 'em in, boys! Merry Christmas.",Barney
19060,Son?!,Barney
19061,Congratulations.,Ted
19062,"You know, that was really cool what you did. When we all needed it, you got us back on the right path.",Robin
19063,It's what I do.,Ted
19064,"Hey, Ted, if I, um, if I ever get married and you're not the guy I'm marrying...",Robin
19065,"Big mistake, but go on.",Ted
19066,"...I could really use someone like you. You know, in case I freak out. When I freak out. You interested?",Robin
19067,Are you asking what I think you're asking?,Ted
19068,"Ted, will you be my best man?",Robin
19069,Scherbatsky... I'm gonna crush it.,Ted
19070,"Hi, there. We've had a lot of fun tonight, but on a more serious note, this is the time of year when we remember the importance of giving. And there's no greater gift than the gift of booty. So, this holiday season, why not bang someone in need? I'm Barney Stinson, and that's... One to grow on.",Barney
19071,"Hi, there. You know, we've had a lot of fun tonight...",Barney
19072,"We've been trying and trying, and still nothing's happened. I'm just worried we can't have children.",Lily
19073,Six days.,Lily
19074,Something must be wrong. W... we're doing it a lot.,Lily
19075,"And everywhere... the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, outside in your wait... the kitchen.",Marshall
19076,"Seriously, Doc, why isn't this happening?",Lily
19077,"Dr. John Stangel? I don't know, baby, do we really need a specialist?",Marshall
19078,"Well, what's your plan, Marshall, just have unprotected sex day after day after day in every position imaginable until...? Wait, it sounded worse in my head.",Lily
19079,"Guys, we've got a problem. This is the application for the regional doubles laser tag tournament in Poughkeepsie. Problem is, only one of you can be my partner. So it looks like we've got a bake-off. You may now present your arguments.",Barney
19080,I'm not playing laser tag.,Marshall
19081,I'm absolutely not playing laser tag.,Ted
19082,Damn it.,Marshall
19083,And Marshall's the winner.,Barney
19084,"Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Stangel. It can't hurt.",Lily
19085,"Yeah, and it cuts in and out.",Barney
19086,Ooh! How did you do it?,Lily
19087,"Oh, God, you found one of the cameras. I swear that's the only one. Wait, which one did you find?",Barney
19088,What are you talking about?,Lily
19089,What are you talking about?,Barney
19090,My visit to a certain Dr. Stangel.,Lily
19091,"Just one, &quot;Dr. Stangel&quot;. Where'd you get the beard?",Lily
19092,"Lily, I've been with Barney since 9:00 a.m. Between the sexual harassment seminar all morning and the secretary beauty pageant all afternoon, he hasn't left my sight.",Marshall
19093,"Wait, so you weren't wearing a fake beard and examining girl parts all day?",Lily
19094,Not today I wasn't.,Barney
19095,"Wow, we finally found Barney's doppelganger. I guess we can tell you now, Lily. That hot dog guy did not look like Barney.",Ted
19096,"Uh, Marshall?",Lily
19097,"Yes, I know, we made our little deal with the universe, but...",Marshall
19098,"No, we've made a binding covenant with the universe. We said we weren't going to try to have kids until we saw Barney's doppelganger. Oh, this is bad news. This is like a black cat walked through my uterus. Okay, that's it. I am going back to Dr. Stangel and getting thoroughly checked out.",Lily
19099,Or... or cost-saving alternative: you could get checked out by someone who looks just like him. I'm gonna go scrub up. I'll meet you in stall three.,Barney
19100,I still kind of think it's Barney.,Lily
19101,There's no way it's Barney.,Marshall
19102,"It's Barney. Wow. Really, dude, bravo. You almost got a peek. But seriously, what second-rate community theater did you get...?",Marshall
19103,So my wife and I are trying to get pregnant.,Marshall
19104,"Uh-uh, no. Can't do it.",Lily
19105,"No, but, baby, I yanked on his beard.",Marshall
19106,"No, Barney... Doctor, wait, please, it's... Can you just give us a couple minutes? I... Lily, how can I convince you that this is not Barney?",Marshall
19107,"Wow, it is like looking into a poorly dressed mirror.",Barney
19108,Okay. Convinced.,Lily
19109,&quot;Suit up&quot;... not convinced. This whole thing stinks to high heaven.,Lily
19110,"Baby, you just saw Barney.",Marshall
19111,He could have pulled some crazy switch. Remember when his Swedish cousin came to visit?,Lily
19112,"Oh, yeah... Bjorney.",Marshall
19113,"Yeah, I'm sorry, but unless I see Barney at the same time, I... I'll never be sure that Dr. Stangel isn't him.",Lily
19114,"How you doing, Lily?! Should I have a boner?!",Barney
19115,Thank you.,Lily
19116,"Hey, you don't mind if I take pictures, do you?!",Barney
19117,Can we leave him in here for a while?,Lily
19118,"Aw, yeah. Smile for the birdie, Lil! Gyno-mite!",Barney
19119,"So, first day of work?",Ted
19120,"Hi, guys.",Robin
19121,Sandy Rivers?!,Ted
19122,"Oh, I hate that guy.",Ted
19123,It gets worse.,Robin
19124,You had sex with Sandy Rivers?,Ted
19125,"No! Ugh! And I can't believe it's my first day, and already I'm the girl who slept with the host of the show.",Robin
19126,Already? Were you planning on eventually sleeping with the host?,Ted
19127,"Well, now that I know it's Sandy, I'm not.",Robin
19128,"Hey, babe.",Marshall
19129,"Hi, honey. There's a couple messages on the machine. Your dad called. He wants to know if you have any sixes.",Lily
19130,"Yeah, uh, we got a game of &quot;Go Fish&quot; going on the phone. P.S., Pops, go fish. Who's the second message from?",Marshall
19131,Dr. Stangel's office. I'm extremely fertile.,Lily
19132,"You're extremely fertile! Oh, my God. I told you there was nothing to worry about. I got to call my dad and tell him the good news. If you're fertile, um, then that means I'm the problem.",Marshall
19133,"Okay, now you're being ridiculous. An hour ago, you didn't even think there was a problem.",Lily
19134,"Well, I was just putting on a brave face. Okay, think about it: we've had unprotected sex 203 times in the past four months. Obviously I'm the problem.",Marshall
19135,Problem?! You can't get a girl pregnant. That's the dream. I'd give my firstborn to not be able to have children.,Barney
19136,"So, second day of work?",Ted
19137,What's wrong?,Lily
19138,"Oh, you didn't hear? She's the office slut.",Ted
19139,"Already? Oh, honey.",Lily
19140,I wish I was the office slut.,Robin
19141,And we can explore how those policy changes will affect Iraq.,Robin
19142,We did not have sex.,Robin
19143,"I don't know, maybe because I'm a smart, talented, professional.",Robin
19144,Thank you.,Robin
19145,We did have sex.,Robin
19146,But this reporter takes pride in...,Robin
19147,And now everyone calls me Scherpoopie. It's not funny.,Robin
19148,"Robin, a word of advice: play along. Okay, the more you fight it, the worse it's going to get. It's like when your car slides on ice, you steer into the skid.",Ted
19149,"Exactly! Or when your... I don't know... friend invites you to a laser tag tournament, you don't fight it. You just strap on the vinyl holster and race into that abandoned JCPenney g*n a-blazin'. I'm just agreeing with Ted.",Barney
19150,"Oh, it's my dad.",Marshall
19151,Aren't you going to get it?,Ted
19152,"No, no, you know what? Um, I'm gonna get my stuff checked out first. I'll call my dad after Dr. Stangel gives me the thumbs up.",Marshall
19153,He has to do that?,Ted
19154,But I thought you talk to your dad about everything.,Robin
19155,"I only like to call my dad with good news. I mean, telling him good news is what makes it feel real to me.",Marshall
19156,I'm getting married!,Marshall
19157,I passed the bar!,Marshall
19158,"I found an amazing Viking lamp that fits right on the coffee table, as long as we don't mind stepping over the cord.",Marshall
19159,Right?! I found someone who can fix the Viking lamp!,Marshall
19160,"But the news that I might not be able to give him a grandchild? You know, like, I don't even know how to have that conversation.",Marshall
19161,"I'll show you. &quot;Dad, there's, uh, there's something I need to tell you, and it's going to come as a bit of a shock to you, but here goes. You are speaking to the 2011 Tri-County Laser Tag Co-Champion&quot;.",Barney
19162,"Barney, I've already told...",Marshall
19163,"&quot;Oh, and my sperm don't work. Yeah, yeah, the laser tag thing is awesome&quot;.",Barney
19164,"So, third day of work?",Ted
19165,"And the fertilizer is seeping into the ground water, causing...",Robin
19166,"Okay, yes, I, uh, I fell into some manure. It's hilarious, fine. In a five-year career of on-air reports, there are bound to be a few embarrassing moments.",Robin
19167,"Uh, but in my case, it was just the one, and you found it, so, uh... Just the one.",Robin
19168,"Oh, God. What did they find?",Ted
19169,Everything.,Robin
19170,"*Everybody, come and play*... I'm a dirty, dirty girl... *Throw every last care away; Let's go to the mall today; Today, today*... The Federal Reserve Board voted to leave interest... * Let's go to the mall; Today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Let's got to the mall today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Today; Let's go to the mall; Today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Today... ; Let's go to the mall... *",Robin
19171,They even found the video of me getting attacked by an owl.,Robin
19172,You got attacked by an owl?,Ted
19173,I did not get attacked by an owl.,Robin
19174,"Robin, listen, here's what you need to do...",Ted
19175,"Okay, don't you dare tell me to steer into the skid, okay? It's too late. I'm already wrapped around a hydro pole. It's a Canadian telephone pole. I never should have taken this job.",Robin
19176,Show me &quot;owl attack&quot;.,Ted
19177,I am freaking out. Is there a chance that I can't have kids? I've been hit in the nuts a lot.,Marshall
19178,"I can't do it, Doc. Is there, like, another option? Could I... Could I take this home?",Marshall
19179,"Only way I know how, Doc. Only way I know how.",Marshall
19180,Mom. Dad. Uh... What are you doing here?,Marshall
19181,"Go fish. Excuse me. Hey, Lily, can I just talk to you in here for a minute?",Marshall
19182,"Oh, yeah. Isn't it great? They just showed up. Your mom's already rearranged my kitchen, organized my closet... and she asked me if I lost height. Not weight. Height.",Lily
19183,"Yeah, I'm very excited that they're here, too. But right now, I have to get excited about something else.",Marshall
19184,"Oh, okay. Well, I'll go handle your parents. And you handle your, well... Wait, wait, wait. Marshall.",Lily
19185,"Thank you, baby. You're the best.",Marshall
19186,"Uh... Okay, I did a bad thing last night. I looked up his address.",Ted
19187,Who?,Robin
19188,Sorry. You said &quot;who&quot;. It reminded me of the owl footage. Genius. No. Sandy. How dare he laugh at you. Who does he think... Sorry. &quot;Who&quot;. Anyway. I looked up his address in your contact list.,Ted
19189,"Oh, God. Tell me you didn't go over there.",Robin
19190,I just thought he needed to listen to common sense and reasonable discourse.,Ted
19191,"Oh, God. Tell me those aren't the names of your fists.",Robin
19192,They're my feet. I'm actually more of a kicker. So I went to his apartment.,Ted
19193,"Oh, my God. This is...",Robin
19194,"This is how you make sure Sandy never makes fun of you again. I told you to steer into the skid. That was bad advice. So new advice. Steer into Sandy, and run him down.",Ted
19195,If people found out Sandy wears a toupee...,Robin
19196,Really? That's your take-away? Nothing on the bear in the bra?,Ted
19197,"Oh, no. He's very open about that. That's Gregory. Nice guy.",Robin
19198,This isn't working.,Marshall
19199,I'm... I'm going to... I'm... I'm going to...,Marshall
19200,He's going to masturbate.,Lily
19201,Lily!,Marshall
19202,"Marshall, just tell them what's going on.",Lily
19203,"And so, now, I'm just scared that we won't be able to give you a grandchild.",Marshall
19204,"Aw, yeah. Maybe adoption.",Marshall
19205,"Wait, you knew?",Marshall
19206,So? Possibly last day of work?,Ted
19207,"Actually, it was a good day.",Robin
19208,"Actually, Sandy, I have something I think you're all gonna want to see.",Robin
19209,Yes! Put him in a body bag!,Ted
19210,"Okay, I didn't do it.",Robin
19211,What?,Ted
19212,I didn't want to just viciously attack someone out of the blue like some kind of...,Robin
19213,Owl?,Ted
19214,"Exactly. So, instead of taking your advice, I took your advice.",Robin
19215,"Oh, God.",Marshall
19216,It's just...,Marshall
19217,"Damn it, Barney! What are you doing in here?",Marshall
19218,"Think about it, Marshall. All entrants get 20% off at the snack bar! Oh, BT-dub, the receptionist. What's her situation?",Barney
19219,And?,Marshall
19220,My sperm is fine!,Marshall
19221,"Bro, that is awesome. Motility five!",Barney
19222,"Hey, um, can I borrow your phone? I want to call my dad.",Marshall
19223,"Yeah, go ahead.",Ted
19224,"Man, this is great. I was expecting bad news. I really was.",Marshall
19225,"You're here! Oh, my God! I love you so much! Can you believe it?",Marshall
19226,"Marshall... Something's happened. Um... Your father, he had a heart attack. He... he didn't make it.",Lily
19227,My dad's dead? I'm not ready for this.,Marshall
19228,My dad's dead?,Marshall
19229,This is the toughest time in Marshall's life and I feel absolutely useless. What can we do to help?,Ted
19230,"Don't look at me. This morning Marshall said, &quot;I have to pee.&quot; And I, &quot;Don't worry, baby, I'll do it for you.&quot; Halfway through the pee, I'm, like, &quot;This doesn't even make sense!&quot;",Lily
19231,"Well, uh, I've been to a couple funerals, so I know my role: I'm Vice Girl. Whatever Marshall needs to get through this day, I got it right here.",Robin
19232,"Cigarettes, alcohol... Are these firecrackers? My God, Robin, you somehow crammed Tijuana into a purse.",Ted
19233,"Marshall's mom hasn't eaten, slept or sat down since we got here. Wait! That can be my role! I'll take care of Judy!",Lily
19234,"Yeah, but doesn't Marshall's mom hate you--the fact that you two aren't very close?",Robin
19235,"Okay, yes, Judy and I aren't besties, but today, whatever she needs, I'm there. I'm on Judy duty.",Lily
19236,&quot;Judy duty.&quot;,Ted
19237,She said &quot;doody.&quot;,Barney
19238,"Really, guys? At a funeral?",Robin
19239,"Uh, okay, while not all of us possess your lofty sense of decorum, Drug-DealerFrom-An-'80s-After-School-Special, we have to laugh today. It's healthy.",Ted
19240,"Wait a minute! Today, we are gonna make Marshall laugh.",Barney
19241,How?,Robin
19242,"Ted, what's the one thing that always cracks him up?",Barney
19243,Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts.,Ted
19244,"Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts, exactly! So we are gonna get our bro a four-star nad rattler. You search knees, feet, banisters, fire hydrants and diving boards, and I'll cover bats, rackets, hockey sticks, golf clubs and riding crops.",Barney
19245,What about animals?,Ted
19246,"Uh... Claws, paws, talons, hooves, beaks and clenched monkey fists. We can do this!",Barney
19247,"Hey, guys, sorry, uh... I left my charger back in New York, so my phone's out of juice. Does anyone have...?",Marshall
19248,Outlet or USB?,Robin
19249,"Uh, outlet. Thank you. Oh...",Marshall
19250,"Wow, you really do have everything in there, don't you?",Lily
19251,"You're like Mary Poppins, if her magic purse was also filled with drugs.",Ted
19252,"&quot;If&quot;? Ted, the kids in that movie jumped into a painting and spent 15 minutes chasing a cartoon fox. &quot;Spoonful of sugar...&quot;? Grow up.",Robin
19253,Your son?,Marshall
19254,"Guys... Trey Platt terrorized me growing up. He was, he was the toughest bully in school.",Marshall
19255,"Hello, Trey. Long time. Mm-hmm. I was not aware that you had become a reverend.",Marshall
19256,"Marshall Eriksen, you could use a laugh.",Barney
19257,"Yeah! This video is entitled, &quot;Little League Coach Gets Hit in the Nuts by a Foul Ball and Then Vomits in a Garbage Can.&quot; I don't wanna give anything away. Let's just watch.",Ted
19258,"See? 'Cause, 'cause he got hit...",Barney
19259,"...right in the nuts,",Ted
19260,Trey Platt. I can't believe my father's funeral service is being led by Trey &quot;The Noogie Machine&quot; Platt.,Marshall
19261,"That guy gave you noogies? What, did he carry a stepladder?",Ted
19262,He made me carry it.,Marshall
19263,"Bye, Mom.",Marshall
19264,"Yeah, Dad?",Marshall
19265,"I was gonna make a sandwich with that, Dad. Dad, don't they have food on the plane?",Marshall
19266,"&quot;Plane food is ass.&quot; Those are the last words my father will ever say to me. Right after I denied the man a pork chop. Oh, God. Wait! I'm wrong! I'm wrong! That wasn't it! They couldn't find a cab so my dad called up from the street.",Marshall
19267,"And then, well, see, my dad grew up in a small town, in another generation, so sometimes - totally well-meaningly - he'd say stuff like...",Marshall
19268,Dad...,Marshall
19269,My dad's last words to me were a string of odd racial stereotypes.,Marshall
19270,All that stuff was really nice!,Robin
19271,Yeah! It's positive racism!,Lily
19272,This is worse than the pork chop.,Marshall
19273,"This next clip is entitled, &quot;Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets Hit in the Nuts by Low-Flying Seagull&quot;",Barney
19274,Let's see what happens.,Ted
19275,Here he comes... Oh! Oh! 'Cause he gets hit right in the nuts.,Barney
19276,And then the fat kid loses his swim trunks.,Ted
19277,Fall off. Shorts just fall right off.,Barney
19278,"No, wait-- I'm wrong. That wasn't it. They couldn't find a cab, so I went down there.",Marshall
19279,"Hey, you were right. The Kangs did, in fact, have an umbrella.",Marshall
19280,"Bye, Mom.",Marshall
19281,"Crocodile Dundee III is the second-best of the Croc trilogy, so maybe I can live with that<em>. (cell phone beeps)</em> Oh, sorry, my phone's charged.",Marshall
19282,I've been known to locate certain objects from time to time.,Robin
19283,I got ya.,Robin
19284,"Oh, my God.",Marshall
19285,What is it?,Lily
19286,I have a voice mail from my dad.,Marshall
19287,You have a voice mail from your dad?,Lily
19288,How?,Robin
19289,"My phone's been out of juice, so he must've called me the day the he, uh...",Marshall
19290,"Baby, are you okay?",Lily
19291,I hold in my hand the last words my father will ever say to me. I'm gonna hit play.,Marshall
19292,What's wrong?,Robin
19293,What if it's worse than Crocodile Dundee III? I can't do this. I can't... My mom is about to collapse. I'm gonna...,Marshall
19294,"Wait-- no, no, baby... Baby, I got it. Let me.",Lily
19295,You should listen to it. Just don't put too much pressure on it.,Robin
19296,"She's right. I mean, this idea that someone's last words have to be profound and meaningful? I mean, who can live up to that?",Ted
19297,"Exactly. All those &quot;famous last word&quot; people supposedly said? They're all made up. Like that patriotic dude, Nathan Hale, from third-grade history?",Barney
19298,You know what his real last words were?,Barney
19299,True story.,Barney
19300,"The point is, last words are overrated.",Robin
19301,"Look, think of it this way: you get to hear your dad's voice one last time.",Ted
19302,"I should go listen to this... alone, okay? I'll be back.",Marshall
19303,"You heard right. <em>(whispering: )</em> I'm getting a reputation. So, what you need, mama? Come here.",Robin
19304,"Guys, listen to what just happened.",Lily
19305,"Judy, do you need a break? I'm happy to cook for a while.",Lily
19306,Whoa. Are you okay?,Ted
19307,Listen!,Lily
19308,"Judy's finally sleeping and it's all because of me! Guys, I have a role: I'm Judy's bitch! Yeah!",Lily
19309,"Well, but this day is tough on you, too. You sure you can absorb all that?",Ted
19310,"Yeah! Robin gave me a little orange pill from her purse. I don't know what's in it, but things are flowin' pretty smooth right now.",Lily
19311,"Hey, stay hydrated.",Robin
19312,So?,Barney
19313,"I couldn't listen to it. Guys, this is hard.",Marshall
19314,"We know, baby. But you'll always wonder, if you don't. Your dad loved you. It almost doesn't matter what he said.",Lily
19315,It doesn't. That's true.,Barney
19316,"Guys, guys, what if-- God forbid-- all of your dads died right now? What would their last words to you have been? Seriously.",Marshall
19317,"I know mine. When I was in Cleveland last month, I went to visit my dad at his... post-divorce bachelor pad.",Ted
19318,Yeah... so glad we can we can talk about our sex lives now. That's totally an improvement.,Ted
19319,My prom date?!,Ted
19320,I have to go.,Ted
19321,How would you like those to be your father's last words?,Marshall
19322,"Well, they might be. Donna Bromstead's husband is a cop.",Ted
19323,Lawyered. Lily?,Marshall
19324,Hello.,Lily
19325,Fooled ya. Leave a message after the beep. We'll get back to ya. Beep.,Lily
19326,Lawyered. Robin?,Marshall
19327,That's awful.,Ted
19328,"No, here's the awful part.",Robin
19329,You remembered my birthday!,Robin
19330,"Lawyered. Now can we all just admit that last words are, in fact, a big deal?",Marshall
19331,"Man, I always thought I had it rough not really knowing my dad, but... now I realize at least I'll never have to suffer like this. Our next video is called &quot;German Shepherd Activates Tennis Ball Cannon While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink.&quot;",Barney
19332,"Barney, please, Barney! It's... No more videos, okay? I just need a minute.",Marshall
19333,"Whoa, they grow big out here.",Robin
19334,And here's your phone number back.,Barney
19335,"Judy, I...",Robin
19336,I did it.,Lily
19337,I'm from New York. We think getting minors drunk is funny.,Lily
19338,"That salad's the first food she's eaten in two days. Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise and jelly beans, but it counts.",Lily
19339,"Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Marshall laugh once.",Ted
19340,Yeah. Showing videos of guys getting hit in the nuts wasn't going to do anything. I'm just stupid.,Barney
19341,Stupid.,Ted
19342,What we need to do is hit each other in the nuts.,Barney
19343,Yes. Nothing b*at the immediacy of live theater. But which one of us is going to take the hit?<em>(Barney hits Ted in the nuts)</em> So that's it? No discussion?,Ted
19344,"I'm not going to listen. &quot;Rent Crocodile Dundee II&quot; are the last words that my father will ever say to me, and I think I can live with that.",Marshall
19345,Is he laughing?,Ted
19346,These stories suck.,Ted
19347,Doesn't hold a candle to your Crocodile Dundee thing.,Robin
19348,"You're up next, baby.",Lily
19349,I just need some air.,Marshall
19350,"Baby, are you okay?",Lily
19351,I have to listen to it. It's a pocket dial. It's nothing.,Marshall
19352,"Hey, so it's a pocket dial. You have so many great memories with your dad. Who cares about the last one?",Lily
19353,She's right. Your dad was hilarious.,Barney
19354,"You guys don't get it, okay? None of you do. My dad was my hero. And he was my teacher. And he was my best friend. He always came through for me. And now he's just gone. And what am I left with? (<em>scratchy electronic sounds)</em> Thanks a lot, God! Thank you! You took my father, the greatest man that I have ever known, and you ripped him off this Earth, way too young! And he'll never get to meet our kids, Lily. <em>(scratchy sounds continue)</em> But we got this voice mail. Thank you so much for the voice mail! It's a great comfort! 'Cause whenever I'm starting to feel lonely or sad, or-- or you know what, or maybe a little bit cheated, at least I got the sound of his pocket to console me. How is this fair? You know, like, an entire human life and it just ends for no reason, and... and what are we left with?",Marshall
19355,Looks like your dad came through one last time.,Lily
19356,&quot;I love you.&quot; My father's last words to me are &quot;I love you.&quot;,Marshall
19357,&quot;I love you.&quot; My father's last words to me are &quot;I love you.&quot;,Marshall
19358,"Bye, Pop.",Marshall
19359,Then my father said the last words that he'll ever say to me: &quot;Rent Crocodile Dundee III. I caught it on the cable last night and it totally holds up.&quot;,Marshall
19360,For what?,Lily
19361,Any time.,Lily
19362,"Oh, man. I should have rented Crocodile Dundee III.",Marshall
19363,"Okay, seriously, how are you doing that?",Ted
19364,"Thanks. I'll be right back. And if I don't come back, well, then these are my last words to you all. I really, really, really love you guys. Now I'm going to go drop a deuce.",Marshall
19365,"Hi, Dad.",Ted
19366,"Hi, Dad.",Lily
19367,"Hi, Dad.",Robin
19368,"Hey, Mom. I'm ready to meet my dad.",Barney
19369,"Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.",Marshall
19370,"No. It's called manners, jerk. Now, what's-what's going on in New York? Give me something.",Marshall
19371,"There is one thing that's been going on. Uh, it's about Ted... and Zoey.",Robin
19372,I thought the oven was Celsius.,Robin
19373,It's okay. We got hot dogs.,Ted
19374,"Yeah, and it's not like you can screw up a hot dog. Oh, God. This is so good. I'm gonna finish it in the bathroom.",Lily
19375,I hope I can pass this hot dog.,Barney
19376,"Well, looks like someone's going out in the cold to get more ketchup.",Ted
19377,Which is all gone.,Ted
19378,"Hmm, tell you what... no dice.",Ted
19379,You're not getting out of this.,Ted
19380,I'll get the ketchup.,Ted
19381,"Robin, I just want you to know, it's either this story you're telling me or another game of Clue against myself, so make it good.",Marshall
19382,"Oh, it's good. You see, after that night, none of us heard from Zoey for a while.",Robin
19383,"Finally, Ted called her up.",Robin
19384,"So are we ever gonna see you again? Because, if I recall correctly, you owe me a date with your hot cousin.",Ted
19385,Yes. And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.,Ted
19386,"Hi, Honey, I'm Ted.",Ted
19387,"She is a lovely person... warm, intelligent, just kind of gullible. It's like, every word out of her mouth makes you want to be like, &quot;Oh, honey.&quot;",Robin
19388,Interesting. Show your work.,Marshall
19389,"Oh, honey.",Marshall
19390,"Oh, honey.",Marshall
19391,"Oh, honey.",Marshall
19392,"Oh, honey.",Marshall
19393,"I know. You just want to wrap her up in a blanket and give her a cup of tea. She's, like, this little lost lamb who needs to be protected from the wolves. Speaking of whom...",Robin
19394,"Oh, honey.",Barney
19395,"So the night went on, and eventually everyone went home, except for Ted and Honey.",Robin
19396,Why do they call 'em coasters?,Barney
19397,And Barney.,Robin
19398,"Ted, a word. God, I hate these situations. What are we gonna do about this?",Barney
19399,What are you talking about?,Ted
19400,"Come on, Ted, it's obvious. Honey's vibing on me.",Barney
19401,What?,Ted
19402,It's called body language. Remember when she was touching your arm and leaning in real close?,Barney
19403,Mm-hmm.,Ted
19404,"Well, while that was happening, the straw in her drink was pointed right at me. I mean... that's as clear as a signal gets, so... I'm so sorry, man.",Barney
19405,"You're right. She's all yours, buddy. I'd say hump her brains out, but someone obviously already has.",Ted
19406,"Good for you. Ted Mosby does not take advantage of poor, helpless honeys.",Robin
19407,"Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.",Ted
19408,Hmm?,Robin
19409,"Mom, hang up!",Marshall
19410,Go on.,Marshall
19411,"Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.",Ted
19412,Hmm?,Robin
19413,I'm in love with Zoey.,Ted
19414,"Oh, my God.",Marshall
19415,Mom!,Marshall
19416,"Ted's in love with Zoey? But, but she's married. That boy needs an intervention.",Marshall
19417,Funny you should say that.,Robin
19418,Does anyone know why we're here?,Barney
19419,"Yeah, who called this intervention?",Lily
19420,I did. It's for me. This is about the coffee breath.,Ted
19421,Finally.,Lily
19422,"Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair.",Robin
19423,"Guys, just let the man explain how it's all about his wearing a lady's watch.",Barney
19424,"It's because I'm in love with Zoey, and she's married, so it needs to stop. And... intervene.",Ted
19425,Are you sure it's love?,Lily
19426,"Remember the ketchup bottle? She wasn't the one who dropped it. When she reached for it, our fingers touched, and...<em>(glass shatters)</em> I knew, right in that moment, this isn't friendship. This is love.",Ted
19427,Marcus! This is a private conversation! So what'd the wuss do next?,Marshall
19428,"This is love. And this was my grandmother's watch. Anyway, now I have only one course of action in front of me: I have to end my friendship with Zoey.",Ted
19429,Isn't that a little harsh?,Robin
19430,"Harsh? Robin, a single guy and a married woman cannot be friends if one's in love with the other.",Lily
19431,"Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now, too. It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her. She'll always be around.",Robin
19432,Then what am I supposed to do?,Ted
19433,"Okay, just shut it down. Okay, just ignore your feelings. If-If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self. Look, I like Zoey. Without her, my dinner party wouldn't have been such a success. So those feelings of yours... shut 'em down.",Robin
19434,Fine. I'll shut 'em down.,Ted
19435,"And seriously, mouthwash after coffee.",Lily
19436,"Oh, um, that's my other line. It's not a number I recognize.",Marshall
19437,So don't answer it.,Robin
19438,Yeah.,Marshall
19439,"Well, it would be. Good-bye. Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.",Marshall
19440,"Hey, Marshall.",Barney
19441,Barney. W- What number is this?,Marshall
19442,"I'm up on burners, playa. Too many crazies had my old number, so now I'm all about disposable cell phones. I'll use one for a while, have my fun, then dump it and get a new one. And then I'll do the same with my phone.",Barney
19443,"Hey, uh, so Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing.",Marshall
19444,"Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story. I'll tell you that story.",Barney
19445,Uh... Robin's version was...,Marshall
19446,"That is exactly how it happened. So Ted did his best to impress her, but as per yoozh, he bored the pants very much on her.",Barney
19447,"Blah, blah, blah, I'm an architect. Blah, blah, blah, I don't wear suits. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.",Ted
19448,"Blah, blah, blah, blah. Rambling architecture anecdote. Blah, blah, something about a bridge. Blah, blah, blah...",Ted
19449,"Anyway, I get Honey back to her place.",Barney
19450,Who's your daddy?,Barney
19451,"Okay, can we skip this part, please?",Marshall
19452,"Sure, I'll just summarize it. <em>(imitating squeaky bedsprings)</em>",Barney
19453,"Okay, that's been going on a while.",Marshall
19454,"Only way I know how. Any-who, next day, I'm going into work. I run into Zoey.",Barney
19455,"Hey, Zoey. That cousin of yours... Honey... yowsa! I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts.",Barney
19456,"Yeah, we had a great time last night. And then just hand stuff in the morning, so...",Barney
19457,"Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize... (<em>imitating squeaky bedsprings)</em>",Barney
19458,She hugged me. What was that all about?,Barney
19459,Marcus!,Marshall
19460,Wow. Zoey's in love with Ted.,Marshall
19461,"Sure. Hey, where's the...? No! Aah!",Marshall
19462,"So Ted's in love with Zoey and Zoey's in love with Ted? Well, that-that's not going to work. I got to call Ted.",Marshall
19463,Hello.,Ted
19464,"Listen, Ted, um, I got to tell you something about Zoey.",Marshall
19465,"Yeah, yeah. I need to tell you something about Zoey, too.",Ted
19466,Can I get you a beer?,Ted
19467,"Listen, Zoey, I, um... I need to tell you something. Um...",Ted
19468,Mom! Get off the phone!,Marshall
19469,"Marcus, hang up! Both of you, hang up! And we need ice cream. Go on.",Marshall
19470,"I, uh... I can't be friends with you anymore. And this may seem strange, but... you can't ask me why.",Ted
19471,And that was it. No more Zoey.,Ted
19472,"Oh. Hey, buddy, that's Lily. I should take that. But, uh, you're a good guy, Ted. Hey, baby.",Marshall
19473,We hate Ted now. Get on board or the sexting stops.,Lily
19474,"Ted's a son of a bitch! (cell phone chirps) Oh, nice. But, hey, um, baby, go easy on Ted, okay? He just, he just ended things with Zoey.",Marshall
19475,"Oh, I know. But did he tell you the whole story?",Lily
19476,"I, uh, I can't be friends with you anymore. And you can't ask me why.",Ted
19477,Lily hates you.,Ted
19478,That's crazy. I don't hate you.,Lily
19479,"He... Oh, really? And-And what did Ted say, exactly?",Lily
19480,Lily hates you. She hates you so much it's hard to be around you. So we can't be friends.,Ted
19481,"Oh, he... Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay, well, I- I guess there's no use hiding it anymore. I- I hate you. Bitch.",Lily
19482,Difficult stuff? What difficult stuff?,Marshall
19483,I don't know.,Lily
19484,"Well, you did the right thing, baby.",Marshall
19485,Not entirely.,Lily
19486,"Zoey, wait! I don't hate you! We just can't be friends anymore because... Robin hates you.",Lily
19487,And that's Robin on the other line.,Marshall
19488,"Oh, well, I'll let you take that. Love you, baby!",Lily
19489,"Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking... Listen, Robin. I know. I apologize for my wife. She never should have...",Marshall
19490,"Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her.",Robin
19491,Me? You dragged me into this?!,Marshall
19492,You just went through a tragedy. It's not like she's gonna call you up and...,Robin
19493,"Oh, God, that's my other line. Oh, God, it's a 917 number, and I don't recognize it! I think it's Zoey!",Marshall
19494,Just don't answer it.,Robin
19495,I can't not answer. It's impolite.,Marshall
19496,"Marshall, you can b*at this.",Robin
19497,I can't turn my back on politeness.,Marshall
19498,You don't have to answer. You can just let it ring.,Robin
19499,Good manners are what separate us from those &quot;elbows on the table&quot; Wisconsinites.,Marshall
19500,"You can do this. I believe in you. Don't do it, Marshall!",Robin
19501,"I'm sorry, Robin! Eriksen residence. Marshall speaking.",Marshall
19502,"Oh, honey. Oh! Honey! Zoey's cousin.",Marshall
19503,"Listen, um, about Barney...",Marshall
19504,Who's your daddy?,Barney
19505,So I wrote him a letter. And I poured my heart out. And I gave him my number and I told him to call me. And he still hasn't called me.,Barney
19506,"I mean, I shouldn't be surprised. Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me.",Barney
19507,"I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son.",Barney
19508,Four. Four Nobel Prizes.,Barney
19509,Only three.,Barney
19510,"Hey, uh, listen, Honey, while I've got you, do you have any idea what kind of difficult stuff Zoey's been going through?",Marshall
19511,I am her therapist.,Marshall
19512,"Uh, okay, listen, I think we've made great progress for today. I got to go. Bye. Mom! Marcus!",Marshall
19513,I told you. Lily hates you.,Ted
19514,All right. Yes. I... hate you.,Ted
19515,Zoey.,Ted
19516,"So we got Ted and Zoey. Ted is in love with Zoey. Zoey has no idea. Then Zoey's cousin Honey went home with Barney, and Zoey was happy about it. Which tells us what?",Marshall
19517,"Zoey's in love with Ted and Ted doesn't know. So Ted and Zoey... they're in love with each other, which would be fine if Zoey wasn't married to Colonel Mustard. I mean, The Captain. Except now, as Honey informs me...",Marshall
19518,And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.,Ted
19519,Zoey and The Captain are getting divorced. Which means...?,Marshall
19520,Give me that phone.,Marshall
19521,"Why do I hate you? Are you kidding? Uh, you're actively trying to prevent me from realizing a lifelong dream. So there's that. Plus, you're stubborn and-and-and argumentative. And what kind of name is Zoey, huh? What is that, short for Zoseph? <em>(cell phone ringing)</em> Go on, get it. I'll have more in a second.",Ted
19522,Why was Marshall calling?,Ted
19523,"You talk during movies. You-You-You sneeze with your whole body. Uh, to my knowledge, you do not speak Portuguese.",Ted
19524,You're a show-off.,Ted
19525,"Uh, hey, Marshall, can I call you back? I'm out in the hallway with... She is? She is? Marshall, I got to go.",Ted
19526,They're kissing?! Yeah! (<em>screams)</em> They're kissing!,Marshall
19527,"Look, um... I know you're going through a lot right now. Getting divorced, being single, figuring out who you are on your own.",Ted
19528,I just mean... I'm okay taking this slow. I want to do this right.,Ted
19529,"You're doing this all wrong! Ted, there are couples in my kindergarten class who have moved faster than you two. Granted, their home lives are not great.",Barney
19530,"Hey, I'm trying. I keep suggesting these big, romantic dates, and she keeps putting on the brakes. Like tonight, she wants me to just come over and bake cookies.",Ted
19531,Oh. Translation: booty-call.,Robin
19532,Total booty-call.,Barney
19533,"Private Booty, reporting for duty.",Lily
19534,That's crazy. She-She wants to bake.,Ted
19535,"Guys booty-call girls after 2:00 a.m. with a drunkenly slurred, &quot;What ya doing?&quot; But when a lady booty-calls a guy, she invents a respectable excuse to mask the fact that she wants to get stuck real good.",Robin
19536,"It's called class, Ted.",Lily
19537,Wait. That... You think that's what she means by &quot;baking cookies&quot;?,Ted
19538,"Are you kidding? You're in the kitchen, it's getting hot, you start licking stuff off each others' fingers. Before you know it, she's bent over the marble island, and you're spanking her with a rubber spatula. And she's screaming, &quot;Stop, Marshall, stop,&quot; but that's just code for &quot;harder!&quot;",Lily
19539,"Marshall's been in Minnesota a while, huh?",Ted
19540,So long! And now he's staying even longer. His mom has been having a really hard time since the funeral. He's waiting on her hand and foot. But... it's Valentine's Day. It's not going to be the same without the two of us watching Predator together.,Lily
19541,"You know, I saw this in the theater, like, five times, but I never got to see it with the right girl.",Marshall
19542,I'm so glad none of those girls were right for you.,Lily
19543,What girls?,Marshall
19544,"Wow, you sound really lonely.",Barney
19545,"I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears...",Lily
19546,"Shh. Daddy's talking now. Loneliness. The looming specter of Valentine's Day fast approaching. The two key ingredients to my favorite day of the year, February 13: Desperation Day.",Barney
19547,That's not a thing.,Robin
19548,"It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death.",Barney
19549,That's actually true.,Ted
19550,"Wait, there's more.",Barney
19551,This won't be.,Ted
19552,"And right by Saint Valentine's side was his best bro, Saint Desperatius, there to pick off insecure bridesmaids.",Barney
19553,"Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day. That neediness reaches its climax... what up... on February 13. A magical night when a ten has the self-esteem of a four and the depraved enthusiasm of a two. Now, there's only one thing you can't do.",Barney
19554,Please say &quot;widows.&quot;,Robin
19555,"Wherever you are, or whoever you're under, you must get home alone by 11:59 p.m. Otherwise, you're on a date on Valentine's Day.",Barney
19556,"Barney, Desperation Day assumes that all single women freak out about Valentine's Day. Which we do not. Case in point, I will be spending February 13 with some lovely single ladies from work...",Robin
19557,Trolls.,Barney
19558,...who could care less about Valentine's Day.,Robin
19559,Lying trolls.,Barney
19560,"And we will be celebrating the fact that we don't have to spend it with some dippy guy carting around roses and stuffed toys all night. Oh, no offense, Ted.",Robin
19561,And none was taken until just then.,Ted
19562,I decided to go to Minnesota to see Marshall. He shouldn't have to help his mom through this rough time all by himself.,Lily
19563,"You losing your mind, being alone in your apartment?",Barney
19564,I'm getting weird!,Lily
19565,"See, it started off with me throwing Marshall's jersey on my body pillow. And, well, things kind of spiraled from there. I'm sorry I yelled like that before.",Lily
19566,I call him &quot;Marshpillow.&quot; And he calls me... nothing because he's a pillow.,Lily
19567,Hey. How was &quot;baking cookies&quot; last night?,Robin
19568,You brought an overnight bag?,Lily
19569,You guys said I was definitely going to spend the night.,Ted
19570,"We said you were going to have sex. We didn't say, &quot;Bring a carry-on.&quot;",Barney
19571,So how did Zoey react?,Robin
19572,She thought it was presumptuous and asked me to leave. It's-It's not like I brought a ton of stuff.,Ted
19573,Were there slippers for the morning?,Robin
19574,"Not slippers, exactly.",Ted
19575,They're called British morning socks.,Ted
19576,"How are you holding up, Judy?",Lily
19577,"Hey, Mom? I hate to be that guy, but I'm pretty sure it was Hot Pocket o'clock, like, ten minutes ago. Lily. What are you doing here?",Marshall
19578,I wanted to surprise you.,Lily
19579,"Oh, my gosh. That's so sweet. I'm so glad you're here. Hey, um, before I forget, Mom, did you remember to get more double-A batteries?",Marshall
19580,"Oh, great, okay. I don't want my Game Boy to crap out. I'm having the sickest Dr. Mario run of my life. Okay. I'll be right back. I love you, Lily. Okay. You're the best, Mom.",Marshall
19581,I thought he was here helping you.,Lily
19582,"Uh, I'll talk to him.",Lily
19583,"Oh, God.",Lily
19584,"Listen, that was a dumb move for me to just assume...",Ted
19585,We totally did.,Ted
19586,They're actually called British morning socks.,Ted
19587,Right. Okay.,Ted
19588,"Um, Marshall, your mom asked me to carry this up. She turned her ankle on your Hot Wheels. Is my track okay? It's fine, but, Marshall, I thought you were here taking care of your mom. It seems like she's taking care of you.",Lily
19589,"My mom loves to feel needed. Letting her take care of me is how I'm taking care of her. She's in a dark place, Lily. She needs this. Mom? You forgot my chocolate milk with the swirly straw!",Marshall
19590,"Marshall, tomorrow's Valentine's. Don't you want to be at home on our couch, cuddling up under a warm blanket, watching the Predator use his heat vision to stalk helpless prey?",Lily
19591,"Well, baby, we could watch Predator here. No, my mom can go rent it for us after she's done digging out the car.",Marshall
19592,"Marshall, your mom wants you out of here.",Lily
19593,What?,Marshall
19594,"Mom, d-do you want me to leave?",Marshall
19595,"But, Judy, you said...",Lily
19596,"Yeah. You know, there's this new Italian restaurant on 79th that's supposed to be amazing.",Ted
19597,"Tomorrow night, my place.",Ted
19598,Isn't that great?,Ted
19599,"Yeah, if you say so, yeah.",Robin
19600,What do you mean?,Ted
19601,"Look, she just got out of a marriage, Ted. That's heavy. I'm kind of freaking out, just listening to you. My heart is pounding, I'm hearing this weird clicking noise.",Robin
19602,"Well, it's romantic, right? Zoey and I are getting serious on Valentine's Day.",Ted
19603,"See, that just amps up the pressure even more. Boy, it's a good thing that you're sure.",Robin
19604,"Who said I wasn't sure? I'm glad we're in a serious relationship. Right away. And if I screw this up, I'm the devil, because she's going through a divorce. But I'm not going to screw this up. So stop freaking out, Robin. Stop freaking out!",Ted
19605,Hi! I'm here to help Marshall.,Ted
19606,"God, these girls are so hungry for male attention. It is like being a hunter and having the deer walk up, tie itself to the hood of your car and beg to get mounted.",Barney
19607,"Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex.",Robin
19608,EnchantÃ©. That's French for &quot;What's with the purple?&quot;,Barney
19609,"Well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and everything is pink and red, so Bev very thoughtfully suggested that we wear purple to show how little we care.",Robin
19610,"And we don't care about some stupid, sexist, corporate holiday.",Robin
19611,Please! You might as well be dog-earing a tear-stained bridal magazine while wolfing down the box of chocolates you had delivered to yourself at work from your &quot;fiancÃ©&quot; who no one's ever met.,Barney
19612,Ted... I thought you were going to talk to Marshall about coming back to New York.,Lily
19613,"Yeah, but, you know, things move so fast in New York. Why not hang out here until at least after Valentine's Day. Plus, we're helping Marshall's mom. Uh, Mrs. Eriksen, we're running low on SunnyD!",Ted
19614,"Okay, when your &quot;fiancÃ©&quot; Gerard comes back from fixing cleft palates in Peru, maybe snatch a photo of the two of you together, and then I'll totally believe you.",Barney
19615,"Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna b*at him in an arm wrestle?",Robin
19616,My elbow slipped!,Barney
19617,"Marshall, I'm going home.",Lily
19618,What?,Marshall
19619,"I'm flying out tonight before the big storm, and I want you to come with me.",Lily
19620,"I can't right now, 'cause my mom needs me.",Marshall
19621,While I'm sure it's been really helpful for her to have you here playing Super Mario Kart for 14 hours a day...,Lily
19622,You have Super Mario Kart?!,Ted
19623,"Hell, yeah.",Marshall
19624,But your mom doesn't need you. Your life in New York needs you. It needs you really bad.,Lily
19625,"Baby, don't go.",Marshall
19626,Please come home soon.,Lily
19627,"So, you were an Olympic gymnast?",Barney
19628,"Ooh, sorry. Gold's the only thing that really counts.",Barney
19629,"And she sticks the landing. Why don't you start stretching, and I'll... be right back. Hey, hey, sorry.",Barney
19630,Quick question.,Barney
19631,Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends?,Barney
19632,Sure.,Barney
19633,"Oh, my gosh! Me, too! Um, is it getting crowded in here, 'cause I think there are two peas in this pod?",Barney
19634,"Guilty. This is embarrassing but every year, I buy flowers and a box of chocolates, even if I'm not with someone. Just in case, you know?",Barney
19635,The worst.,Barney
19636,What's that?,Barney
19637,"I miss my dad, Ted. I miss him so much.",Marshall
19638,I know.,Ted
19639,"Um, when I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula. And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till, like, the middle of the night. And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything.",Marshall
19640,"All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13... a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate.",Barney
19641,"Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie.",Barney
19642,Here's the first thing you need to know about laser tag.,Barney
19643,"Thanks a lot for coming out here, man.",Marshall
19644,Yeah.,Ted
19645,"Hey, are-are you sure it's okay with Zoey that you're here for Valentine's Day?",Marshall
19646,"Well, I mean, technically, she doesn't know yet.",Ted
19647,What?,Marshall
19648,"Things with Zoey are moving really fast, and the divorce just makes everything more complicated. I just, I needed to take a step back.",Ted
19649,"You're not taking a step back. You're running away. And hiding out here, hiding out here is not gonna solve anything. You're just holed up in Minnesota because you're too scared to face reality, and it's... We got to go back to New York, tonight.",Marshall
19650,We're snowed in. Lily got the last flight.,Ted
19651,"So, we drive. It's time. It's time to get back to real life. It's time to grow up. Yeah Mom! Can you make us some PB and J's for the road?",Marshall
19652,Crusts cut off.,Ted
19653,"Crusts cut off! No, Ted. What are we...? We're men. Mom! Leave the crusts on! They forced their opponents to scatter, picking them off, one by one, in a swift and merciless slaughter.",Marshall
19654,...became the 2010 Tri-County Champions.,Barney
19655,"Oh, it is. Plus, if you win, you get free pizza. This is my teammate for tomorrow.",Barney
19656,"Oh, yeah, I agreed to that.",Robin
19657,Well...,Robin
19658,What?,Robin
19659,"What...? So that's it? A couple of white Urkels offer you sausages, and you're gone? What about the sisterhood? Solidarity? The color purple?",Robin
19660,I thought we didn't care about Valentine's Day.,Robin
19661,"I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news.",Barney
19662,"What? No, don't go! You want to see a magic trick?!",Barney
19663,Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day...,Robin
19664,What are you talking about?,Barney
19665,"Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora.",Robin
19666,"No, I don't. She's gross.",Barney
19667,Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain.,Robin
19668,Whatever you say.,Barney
19669,"Oh, hey, Nora.",Robin
19670,Nora...,Barney
19671,"Well, that was kind of presumptuous.",Ted
19672,"The ground was shaking like. Robin, where are you? Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot since last year. They're terrifying!",Barney
19673,"Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day.",Robin
19674,Hap...?,Barney
19675,Oh!,Barney
19676,"Baby, you're back.",Lily
19677,"Happy Valentine's Day, Lily Pad. Oh.",Marshall
19678,We both knew this would end eventually.,Lily
19679,"Yes, I realize it's raining, but, come on, it's 2021. We can make cell phones that project holograms, but a light drizzle shuts down a whole airport?",Ted
19680,Hey... There she is. Wow.,Ted
19681,Wendy the Waitress! I was just saying-- what are you doing here?,Ted
19682,"So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.",Robin
19683,I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.,Barney
19684,Not according to her.,Robin
19685,You want to grab a drink right now?,Barney
19686,Absolutely.,Barney
19687,How is that a disaster?,Robin
19688,"She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well...",Barney
19689,You want to grab a drink right now?,Barney
19690,Absolutely.,Barney
19691,"It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids.",Barney
19692,"Please, Cheese. You like this girl.",Robin
19693,"What? Nora? No, I don't.",Barney
19694,"Barney, you can't say her name without smiling.",Robin
19695,"That's... Nora. Sorry, sorry. I was thinking of a funny thing that Nora said. Hmm. Stop it. No... ra. Nah... Damn it, what is the matter with me?",Barney
19696,You like her. You should call her.,Robin
19697,"Call her? she had a nice face, her booty was in place, but Barney don't chase.",Barney
19698,"That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice.",Robin
19699,Totally.,Barney
19700,"No, it's a cute story. Once upon a time...",Ted
19701,"Zoey was married to this super rich, super creepy guy called The Captain. So when Zoey and I became friends, I was careful not to cross any lines.",Ted
19702,"I know, right? But then one day, Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight. He flipped out and demanded a divorce. And she was heartbroken. But after a little soul-searching, she ended up back in my and the rest, as they say, is history.",Ted
19703,Oh. A little cold.,Ted
19704,"Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain. I mean this in a super manly way. That guy scares the panties off me.",Ted
19705,"If it's really important to you, I will pick it up tomorrow.",Ted
19706,"All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big meaningless stack of paperwork that I have to get off my desk to make room for tomorrow's big meaningless stack of paperwork. But it's all worth it, you know, 'cause at least I know I'm making the world a... place. All right, see you guys later.",Marshall
19707,I'm worried about Marshall. He doesn't seem like himself lately.,Ted
19708,"Yeah, he's been really... quiet.",Lily
19709,"Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man.",Robin
19710,Like Prince.,Barney
19711,"No, it's more than that. It's like, all the stuff he used to love, he suddenly has no interest in anymore.",Lily
19712,Oh. Ha-wink,Barney
19713,Excuse me?,Lily
19714,"Lily, in my travels, I've developed a finely calibrated sense of how long it's been since... How do I not put this delicately?... a girl's been porked. And, boo, you've been pork-free so long, you're practically kosher.",Barney
19715,It's been a while.,Lily
19716,"Five weeks, three days by my estimation.",Barney
19717,You should work at a carnival.,Lily
19718,I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds.,Barney
19719,"Anyway, we should get going.",Ted
19720,"Yeah, I'll walk out with you guys.",Lily
19721,"Good night. Good night, guys.",Robin
19722,18 weeks.,Barney
19723,"Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and...",Robin
19724,"Shh. Child, listen. If you're really hurting for it, I'd be more than happy to throw you one.",Barney
19725,Throw me one? Yeah.,Robin
19726,We're exes. We're probably due for a backslide. Or we could just do it the normal way.,Barney
19727,"Oh, I see what's going on.",Robin
19728,Yeah?,Barney
19729,"This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your sh*t. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care.",Robin
19730,"Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my sh*t?",Barney
19731,Nora met a guy. What?!,Robin
19732,What?,Barney
19733,Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.,Robin
19734,"But &quot;L'Amour&quot; means love! They're going to the cafe of love! I'm fine. It's fine. Point is, Robin, I don't even like Nora. Damn it!",Barney
19735,"Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed?",Lily
19736,I can't sleep.,Marshall
19737,Mmm. Anything I can do to help you with that?,Lily
19738,Maybe after this documentary on garbage.,Marshall
19739,"Man, I am losing my touch.",Lily
19740,I have to save the planet!,Marshall
19741,Is it over? I call on top.,Lily
19742,I'm here to...,Ted
19743,Captain. I...,Ted
19744,"Pssh, nah...",Ted
19745,Garbage Island. You haven't heard of Garbage Island? It's an island... made of garbage! It's in the Pacific Ocean. It's twice the size of Texas!,Marshall
19746,"In other words, one-eighth the size of Canada. So...",Robin
19747,"Guys, I'm going environmental, okay? Phase one: the bar. I've already convinced MacLaren's to implement a new green initiative.",Marshall
19748,You're welcome... Earth. Phase two: GNB. Tomorrow I'm going to make a presentation in front of the board about how we can cut our carbon footprint by half for only $12 million.,Marshall
19749,"Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is &quot;$12 million,&quot; and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance.",Barney
19750,"Guys, I got a problem. I ran into The Captain.",Ted
19751,Wow.,Ted
19752,Yes! Limit the search to guys with mustaches. Smart.,Ted
19753,And that's the last time you saw her.,Ted
19754,That's damn good brandy.,Ted
19755,"Oh, Captain... don't blame yourself.",Ted
19756,Me. I'm the bad guy.,Ted
19757,"Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero.",Robin
19758,Damn it! The box!,Ted
19759,"Baby, baby, I really got to work on this presentation.",Marshall
19760,"Oh, that's too bad, 'cause I was going to make a little presentation of my own.",Lily
19761,"Okay, why not: from now until tomorrow afternoon, I do this, and then tomorrow night, I do that.",Marshall
19762,"Deal. Come on, come on.",Lily
19763,Lily!,Marshall
19764,"You lying little minx. I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight from 5:00 p.m. until closing, reading a newspaper with two holes cut out of it, and I never saw Nora or this Italian race car driver she's dating.",Barney
19765,Sorry. Who said anything about an...?,Robin
19766,"Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver.",Barney
19767,"No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten.",Robin
19768,"No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite!",Barney
19769,"You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship.",Robin
19770,"No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great penis comes great responsibility.",Barney
19771,"Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one.",Robin
19772,Sorry?,Barney
19773,"I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve.",Robin
19774,"Careful, Robin, I'll do it.",Barney
19775,"Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place.",Robin
19776,"Don't poke the dragon, Robin, 'cause the dragon will poke you back.",Barney
19777,"Sex now, we'll do the foreplay after.",Lily
19778,"Oh, no, baby, come on. Today didn't go so well.",Marshall
19779,"The green initiative, for only $12 million, will change the way...",Marshall
19780,"Well, because we can always do more.",Marshall
19781,"Well, meeting Sting isn't gonna fix anything, Arthur!",Marshall
19782,Meeker got fired because of me. I'm the bad guy.,Marshall
19783,"No, sweetie, just-just put all that out of your mind and relax. Look, I got you a six-pack of tall boys from the deli.",Lily
19784,"Hey, baby.",Marshall
19785,Yeah?,Lily
19786,What happened to the plastic rings that held the six-pack together?,Marshall
19787,"Oh, I-I don't know. I threw them down the garbage chute. Let's just use the handcuffs instead.",Lily
19788,"Baby, birds can get caught in those and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish! Weren't you listening? Don't you care about Garbage Island?",Marshall
19789,"Marshall, right now, I don't give a wat's ass about Garbage Island.",Lily
19790,"Well, I do. I got to find those rings!",Marshall
19791,Cwap.,Lily
19792,"Hi, I'm here to pick up...",Ted
19793,To the study?,Ted
19794,Know what?,Ted
19795,That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?,Ted
19796,"No, no, no, you can't fire him.",Ted
19797,"Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop!",Ted
19798,"Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!",Ted
19799,"But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that.",Ted
19800,Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey.,Ted
19801,"Yeah, yeah! And, you know, since, since it doesn't really matter who Zoey's dating now...",Ted
19802,It's me. You're welcome.,Ted
19803,"Okay, baby, what gives?",Lily
19804,"I'm sorry, but neither of us are getting any action until I find those rings.",Marshall
19805,I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.,Lily
19806,"All right, Robin, give it to me.",Barney
19807,"Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, &quot;Yeah, Barney, go get her!&quot; But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.",Robin
19808,"The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?",Barney
19809,"It's a five, idiot.",Robin
19810,A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?,Barney
19811,&quot;Moon man language&quot;? What does that even mean?,Robin
19812,How am I supposed to see that's a five?,Barney
19813,Look how you taped this up...,Robin
19814,"Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make.",Barney
19815,Barney. Go get her.,Robin
19816,"Listen, Zoey, I need to ask you something. Did I steal you?",Ted
19817,So I'm the bad guy. Great.,Ted
19818,If you say so.,Ted
19819,"Okay, Marshall, seriously, what's going on?",Lily
19820,He'll never get to see how I turn out.,Marshall
19821,What do you mean?,Lily
19822,"My dad. You know, I used to, um, I used to always tell him that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer. And he was always so proud of me for that. But he never got to see the version of me that was anything but a corporate stooge. And now it's too late. And we're starting a family, you know.",Marshall
19823,Are you avoiding sleeping with me 'cause you don't want to start a family?,Lily
19824,"Lily, if we have a baby right now, that is just it for me. The cement will dry, and I will be stuck at GNB forever.",Marshall
19825,"Marshall, if you want to quit your job and go work for the NRDC right now, then you need to do that right now. And then, once you've cleaned up all the oceans and saved the planet... you know, like, a year from now... then we'll start a family.",Lily
19826,"I don't know. So far, in the name of saving the planet, I've ruined your night, I practically broke Wendy's back and I got Meeker fired. The guy must hate me.",Marshall
19827,Meeker doesn't hate you.,Lily
19828,Wow. That's a pretty good omelet.,Ted
19829,"No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well. But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids. It's actually a funny story of how we met. I was a best man at this wedding...",Ted
19830,"Okay, well, have a safe trip. It was great seeing you. <em>(Ted phones Marshall)</em> Hello. Marshall.",Ted
19831,"Hey, Ted.",Marshall
19832,Hey. You will not believe who I just ran into.,Ted
19833,"I don't need to go to a heart doctor. I drink every day, I sleep three hours every night, and I have multiple sex partners. I'm doing everything right.",Barney
19834,"Barney, come on, this is important. We need you around for a long time. Without you, we'd have to find some other sex-fueled, depraved animal to entertain us.",Ted
19835,"Actually, I'm thinking about getting a dog again.",Robin
19836,"Oh, can she? Can she get a dog, please Dad?",Lily
19837,"No. If you get a dog, I'm going to be the one stuck taking care of it.",Ted
19838,You wouldn't have to take care of it.,Robin
19839,Really? And who watered the philodendron on your bookcase and sang it back to life?,Ted
19840,"Yeah, that was made out of silk, Ted.",Robin
19841,"Okay, Robin, what you need is indeed something that buries a bone, but I'm not talking about a dog. I'm talking about a man.",Marshall
19842,Here we go.,Robin
19843,"You're clearly trying to fill a hole... in her heart. You feel like the seventh wheel, because now Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora and Lily's with Big Fudge.",Marshall
19844,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge. &quot;With&quot;? I am not &quot;with&quot; Nora. Wrong preposition. Later tonight I'm hoping to be on Nora, right? Or under Nora, right? Or, we're all adults, I'll just say it... behind Nora.",Barney
19845,I don't know. This will be your second date.,Robin
19846,"Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl.",Lily
19847,"Yeah. Penis feelings. Because she's hot. Guys, as you know, I only have one rule...",Barney
19848,"If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day [...] Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers [...] Never date a girl with a hook for a hand [...]",Barney
19849,Never go out with the same girl more than once.,Barney
19850,Then why are you going out with Nora again?,Lily
19851,There is an exception.,Barney
19852,...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot.,Barney
19853,"And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it. <em>(He</em> sneezes)",Barney
19854,"Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold.",Barney
19855,About 20 minutes. Can't seem to shake it.,Barney
19856,Handsome? Rich? Well-endowed?,Barney
19857,The bed... that's where all the...happens.,Barney
19858,Ah. Thank you.,Barney
19859,"Good night, Mommy.",Barney
19860,"Wow, she nursed you back to health?",Lily
19861,No. I didn't even see her boobs. She just took care of me.,Barney
19862,"Oh, hey, guys. This is Nate. Nate, these are my friends.",Robin
19863,"Uh, yeah, it's right in here... Scooby.",Ted
19864,"Oh, Robin, if you weren't so much stronger than me, I would slap you.",Marshall
19865,What? You told me to meet someone.,Robin
19866,"I know, and, look, he seems plenty nice, but I didn't mean bring home the first guy you bump into on the street.",Marshall
19867,"Actually, I met him in the park.",Robin
19868,Should have just let you get a dog.,Ted
19869,"Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist.",Barney
19870,"Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared?",Lily
19871,No.,Barney
19872,Do you want me to go with you because you're a lot scared?,Lily
19873,Yes!,Barney
19874,"Okay, fine. On one condition. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora. She seems like something special.",Lily
19875,"Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.* Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang *",Barney
19876,"* Bang, bang, bangity bang... *",Barney
19877,"* A bang-bang, bangity-bang. *",Barney
19878,"See, Lily? She was worried.",Barney
19879,"Ow! Nails, nails!",Lily
19880,"Twen... Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight.",Barney
19881,"Well, now it doesn't.",Barney
19882,"Go on, Doctor.",Barney
19883,"Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner.",Barney
19884,"This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing.",Barney
19885,What's that like?,Barney
19886,"My friend's dad passed away from a sudden heart attack. So I'm just getting myself checked out, too.",Barney
19887,Thanks.,Barney
19888,"Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just... No. What is it?",Barney
19889,You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora!,Lily
19890,"That's exactly what I want, too.",Barney
19891,"Okay, but you have to admit that he is a lot of fun.",Robin
19892,"Oh, I actually think he's quite intelligent for what he is.",Marshall
19893,And what is he?,Robin
19894,He's a dog.,Marshall
19895,He's totally a dog.,Ted
19896,What? You saw him hitting on someone?,Robin
19897,"No, I didn't say, &quot;He a dawg.&quot; I said, &quot;He's a dog.&quot; As in, a dog. I think we've all noticed a few curious mannerisms. Or rather, doggerisms.",Marshall
19898,"Uh, Scooby, the tag's still on your jeans.",Ted
19899,"Okay, Scooby, you ready?",Marshall
19900,Good boy!,Ted
19901,That last one did not happen.,Robin
19902,"Okay, you're right. He dropped it.",Marshall
19903,He's not a dog.,Robin
19904,"Robin, it's fine. You said you wanted a dog and you got one. And the best part is, he got his shots.",Ted
19905,You are so playful.,Marshall
19906,Nice job fetching those.,Ted
19907,"Yeah, guys, cut it out. Scooby, sit.",Lily
19908,"So, Scooby, we were thinking if you're going to be hanging out with our Robin, you should be properly vetted.",Marshall
19909,"Uh, yeah. We hope our nosiness doesn't give you &quot;paws.&quot;",Ted
19910,How did you meet?,Lily
19911,Tell us the &quot;tail&quot;,Marshall
19912,"Yes, how did you &quot;whisker&quot; off her feet? Shed a little light on the matter.",Ted
19913,"Did you send her an e-mail, or did you &quot;collar&quot;?",Lily
19914,"Guys, just stop hounding him. Oh, geez.",Robin
19915,"No, no, you're right, Robin. We don't want your new guy to &quot;flea.&quot;",Marshall
19916,We're just trying to make sure he's not a heel.,Lily
19917,"So, moving from Canada, that transition must have been pretty &quot;ruff.&quot;",Ted
19918,"Oh, I bet it was an &quot;Incredible Journey&quot;&quot;",Lily
19919,What part of Canada is that? Speak.,Marshall
19920,This isn't happening.,Lily
19921,"Hey, Nate, why don't you go play some music on the jukebox.",Robin
19922,"Oh, sh**t, dropped my keys.",Robin
19923,"Hey, guys, this is Nora.",Barney
19924,"Well, it's still early.",Robin
19925,I had no idea he had a deep down.,Lily
19926,"I mean, I like being single, but secretly, I want to have kids.",Barney
19927,Three... one of each. You?,Barney
19928,"Yeah, with ivy growing on it.",Barney
19929,And we must have a pool.,Barney
19930,I really am.,Barney
19931,Unbelievable.,Robin
19932,"I assure you, that's not a nickname that I...",Barney
19933,"Barney, you promised you wouldn't lie.",Lily
19934,"I'm not lying! Guys, Nora's really special. In fact... I think I'm... falling in love with her. Guys! I'm serious.",Barney
19935,"I'm not going to let you do this. When Nora gets back here, I'm blowing the whistle.",Lily
19936,"Just make sure it's not a high-frequency whistle, because we don't want to torture Robin's boyfriend.",Marshall
19937,"Guys, this is real. And if you don't make me look good in front of Nora, just remember: I've got dirt on each of you, and I am not afraid to spill it.",Barney
19938,"Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora.",Lily
19939,"Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know... your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig?",Barney
19940,"Mr. Buttons? Oh, you son of a bitch. Fine. I'll be nice.",Lily
19941,Marshall?,Barney
19942,You got nothing on me.,Marshall
19943,The calzone?,Barney
19944,Checkmate.,Marshall
19945,Robin.,Barney
19946,"Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream...",Robin
19947,The Mr. T dream...,Barney
19948,I'm lost.,Robin
19949,Ted?,Barney
19950,Go ahead. Give me your best. My life's an open book.,Ted
19951,The ballet class.,Barney
19952,I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed.,Ted
19953,The 'N Sync concert.,Barney
19954,"1998. Cleveland's g*n Arena, front row. Caught JC's shirt. What else you got?",Ted
19955,"Okay, Ted. The thermos.",Barney
19956,I suppose it's possible Barney has real feelings for Nora.,Ted
19957,I do! So be cool!,Barney
19958,"Sorry, toots. He's taken.",Robin
19959,"Oh, I don't know how we know Barney. How does anyone know how they know anyone? I like your pretty hair, help me.",Lily
19960,"We did not meet him at a strip club. No, sir. Because... Barney don't go to no strip clubs.",Marshall
19961,Once?,Ted
19962,Thermos.,Barney
19963,Nope. Not even once.,Ted
19964,I don't recall.,Lily
19965,"Okay, I think that we're done here, I think that we have adequately established that Barney is... the kind of guy that you would bring home to meet your parents. Okay? So... let's just drop it, all right?",Marshall
19966,"I only have one rule. Never, ever, ever meet a girl's parents.",Barney
19967,Not even if she's hot?,Ted
19968,Not even if her mom's hot.,Barney
19969,I'd love to meet your parents.,Barney
19970,"No, Scooby, you, uh... stay!",Barney
19971,"Oh, no. I got called back in to work. Can you keep an eye on him until I get back? He's new to the city, and he doesn't really know anyone.",Robin
19972,"I knew it. I knew it. I knew if you got a dog, I'd wind up taking care of it.",Ted
19973,He's not a... Good night.,Robin
19974,Whoa. Put that away.,Marshall
19975,"Scooby, we're in our 30s. We don't smoke sandwiches anymore.",Lily
19976,Sandwich brownies?,Ted
19977,Sandwiches make me hungry.,Marshall
19978,Truth. Hey. I have a question.,Ted
19979,Yeah?,Marshall
19980,What did Barney mean when he said &quot;calzone&quot;?,Ted
19981,"Okay, I'll tell you. Okay. One time Barney saw me drop a calzone on the sidewalk, pick it up, and then keep eating it. It feels so good to finally say that out loud. I...",Marshall
19982,Dude. Listen to me. You have nothing to be ashamed of. That calzone sounds amazing.,Ted
19983,"Guys, I found this on the floor.",Lily
19984,"Oh, my God. Scooby ate the whole tray. Wait. Where is he, anyway?",Ted
19985,Scooby got out!,Lily
19986,"Yeah, me, too.",Barney
19987,"I'd love to. <em>(He kisses her)</em> There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants.",Barney
19988,Can you believe...,Barney
19989,"Oh, my God! I found Scooby's wallet.",Lily
19990,"Oh, no! That means the poor guy's out there with no identification.",Marshall
19991,&quot;Got out&quot;? What do you mean?,Robin
19992,He just walked out of the apartment. Someone must've left the door open.,Ted
19993,It wasn't me.,Marshall
19994,Me neither. He must've figured out how to open it himself.,Lily
19995,He's so smart. We should get him on Letterman doing tricks.,Ted
19996,I know Paul Schaffer's sandwich guy. This could happen.,Marshall
19997,Guys. Get yourselves together and start looking for Scooby. I'm on my way home.,Robin
19998,Wait wait! Robin. Can you pick up some calzones?,Ted
19999,"Wait... Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you.",Barney
20000,I was on the spot. This is your fault.,Barney
20001,"Yeah, with the whole &quot;I want to get married&quot; thing. You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship. This... isn't England.",Barney
20002,Great idea.,Ted
20003,"No, great idea!",Marshall
20004,"Okay. If you were new in town and had just ingested an eighth of sandwich, where would you go?",Lily
20005,Of course. Back to the pizza place!,Marshall
20006,Yeah! Maybe that's where Scooby went.,Ted
20007,Who's Scooby?,Marshall
20008,"Hey, have you seen Scooby?",Robin
20009,"Uh, yeah. Isn't that him taking a leak on that fire hydrant?",Barney
20010,Scooby!,Marshall
20011,Day's not over.,Lily
20012,"Okay. Lily, I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down.",Barney
20013,"No, that wasn't the lie. The lie was when you told Nora you were lying. Because you weren't. You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do.",Lily
20014,"Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. 50 years from now, if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another... 32 years. I mean... Nora's great. She's wonderful. But...",Barney
20015,What time was your dinner reservation?,Lily
20016,Last night? 8:30.,Barney
20017,"Your heart's talking to you, Barney. Do you have the guts to listen to it.",Lily
20018,I lied.,Barney
20019,"When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry.",Barney
20020,"So am I. This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but I know it's what I want. I want to be confused. With you.",Barney
20021,"Hi. I'm Barney. Great to meet you. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",Barney
20022,"Vintage rolltop desk here. I haven't decided whether to put the fern on the right or the left side, but you know, sometimes you just gotta wing it. Right? Left side. Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids.",Ted
20023,"Ted. This is your seduction lounge. Sex swing there, vibrating Jell-O pit right there, rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel right here. Don't ask; you're not ready. And that basketball hoop? Outdoor stripper pole. We'll just tell the ladies to be careful in the winter. You think a tongue stuck to a frozen pole is bad...",Barney
20024,"Hey. Barney, let's go outside for a second.",Marshall
20025,We have a confession. This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house. It's an intervention.,Lily
20026,"Oh, thank God. I'll go first. Ted, this hous you bought for your hypothetical family is super weird. We talk about it all the time behind your back.",Barney
20027,Yeah. This intervention isn't for me. It's for you,Ted
20028,"Barney, I can't believe your giant TV is broken. It's March Madness.",Marshall
20029,"Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver?",Ted
20030,"Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks.",Barney
20031,You call the super for a screwdriver?,Lily
20032,"Yeah... here's the thing about me and tools... the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again.",Barney
20033,"Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools.",Ted
20034,"Well, here's our screwdriver now. (<em>Barney opens the door, then whispers loudly:)</em> Guys, I'm pretty sure that's not Luis, but I can't be certain. Someone introduce yourself.",Barney
20035,Dad?,Barney
20036,I can't believe Barney is talking to his dad right now.,Marshall
20037,"Yeah, what do you say after three decades of not seeing each other?",Robin
20038,"&quot;So, how 'bout those last 30 Super Bowls&quot;?",Lily
20039,"Okay, now I feel bad about making fun of him for the tool thing. My dad was the one who taught me all that stuff.",Ted
20040,"Well, to be fair, everyone has some glaring gap in knowledge, something really obvious you somehow never learned.",Robin
20041,"Okay, but a screwdriver? Come on, I don't have any gaps that fundamental.",Ted
20042,Really? I seem to recall...,Robin
20043,Daniel Burnham was an architect whose ever-shifting style and aesthetic made him a true architectural chamma-leeon. And only the most gifted chamma-leeon could've designed classic beaux arts masterpieces right alongside sleek modern flatirons. His name might as well have been Daniel Chamma-leeon.,Ted
20044,"Betty, I'm pretty sure it's pronounced &quot;chamma-leeon,&quot; so... Class dismissed. No homework. For a while.",Ted
20045,"Okay, I learned that word by reading it. That's how I've always pronounced it.",Ted
20046,"Ted, that wasn't easy. It took a lot of &quot;ch-aracter&quot; to admit that.",Robin
20047,"Okay, Scherbatsky. You want to tussle? I'll tussle.",Ted
20048,You want to tussle? Let's tussle.,Robin
20049,Marine biologist.,Ted
20050,"Please, no.",Robin
20051,"Seriously? The North Pole? Okay, pal, if you want to break up with me, just tell it to me straight. Don't pretend you're going someplace we all know doesn't exist.",Robin
20052,"Of who? Santa's elves? Rudolph? You know what? I'm going on a trip, too, Scott. It, uh, starts in Narnia. It works its way up to Candyland, and then, hey, congratulate me, because I'm the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Expelliarmus!",Robin
20053,So... you want to get pizza later? Or...,Robin
20054,I still think about him in the shower.,Robin
20055,"Hey. Tell us everything. How'd it go, bud?",Ted
20056,Where do I begin?,Barney
20057,Yeah. I think I need a drink.,Barney
20058,"Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is... this is going to take me a minute.",Barney
20059,"I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now.",Barney
20060,Make a muscle.,Barney
20061,Ah!,Barney
20062,"Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out.",Barney
20063,"Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that?",Barney
20064,"So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him.",Barney
20065,Why did you abandon me?,Lily
20066,Why'd you wait so long to contact me?,Marshall
20067,"You've hurt me before, why should I trust you now?",Robin
20068,Do you... get laid a lot?,Barney
20069,"Oh, my God, that took you five seconds.",Barney
20070,You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...,Barney
20071,"...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream.",Barney
20072,"Oh, that's cool.",Barney
20073,This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg. (both laughing),Barney
20074,"Barney, we... we know you're psyched, but just... be careful.",Lily
20075,What do you mean?,Barney
20076,"Well, this guy has flaked out on your whole life. It sounds like he just might be telling you what you want to hear.",Ted
20077,"Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt.",Robin
20078,"First of all, Robin, my dad could b*at up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me... I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready.",Barney
20079,"I hope Barney's dad isn't just pretending to be something he's not, you know?",Ted
20080,Yeah. That would make Jerry a real chamma-leeon.,Lily
20081,"You have gaps, too, Lily.",Ted
20082,You got nothing on me.,Lily
20083,"Hey, Lily, can you toss me a beer?",Marshall
20084,"Sure, honey. <em>(She throws the key toward the wall besides Marshall)</em>",Lily
20085,You have terrible aim.,Ted
20086,That's not true.,Lily
20087,"Lily, at our apartment, you're the one who pees on the floor.",Marshall
20088,"Oh, my God. Barney's dad.",Robin
20089,"Yeah, but... aren't you supposed to be off managing some tour in Australia?",Marshall
20090,"What do you mean, Barney won't return your calls? He said you two had an amazing night together.",Lily
20091,I'm not sure how to start this.,Barney
20092,I think I need a drink.,Barney
20093,"Glen McKenna, neat.",Barney
20094,"Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night?",Barney
20095,Wow.,Barney
20096,"Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that?",Barney
20097,"Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass.",Barney
20098,"Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff.",Barney
20099,"Yes, yes, yes.",Barney
20100,*Out of control.*,Barney
20101,You ever bang Stevie Nicks?,Barney
20102,Big-time.,Barney
20103,"Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the &quot;Father Knows Breast,&quot; there's the &quot;Bush Dynasty,&quot; the &quot;Lick Father, Lick Son.&quot;",Barney
20104,Why?,Barney
20105,"You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this.",Barney
20106,We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.,Lily
20107,What?,Barney
20108,You're having dinner with him tonight.,Marshall
20109,"No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that.",Barney
20110,Are you sure it's not more than that?,Robin
20111,"Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again.",Barney
20112,"No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road.",Marshall
20113,"Fine, I'll go.",Barney
20114,"Awesome. Um, Lily, keys. <em>(She throws them way too hard, they land in the trees)</em> I'm literally 11 inches from you.",Marshall
20115,"Oh, thank you very much. And I love your...coat. I love your coat.",Barney
20116,"Well, I do love it. It's doing a nice job covering up that chair.",Barney
20117,Guess now we wait.,Lily
20118,"Hey, I got an idea how to pass the time. A little trivia game. Robin, reindeer: real or fake?",Marshall
20119,"Okay, I'm not an idiot. Reindeer are obviously f... re... fake?",Robin
20120,"Yikes! I'm surrounded by a bunch of dum-dums. Good thing I don't have any gaps in my knowledge. I am perfect. Oh, for the love of God, guys, enough already.",Marshall
20121,"What, baby?",Lily
20122,You've been treating me with kid gloves ever since my dad died.,Marshall
20123,That's not true.,Robin
20124,"Robin, don't disagree with Marshall.",Lily
20125,I'm sorry.,Robin
20126,I first noticed it at the bar.,Marshall
20127,"Hey, Lily, (<em>his voice cracks</em>) Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys. [...] The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie.",Marshall
20128,"It ages well, that's the thing.",Barney
20129,You guys like my new soul patch?,Marshall
20130,"Righteous hair tab, brotha.",Robin
20131,"And once I figured it out, I started doing crazy stuff to see how far you'd let me go. [...]Hey, guys. This is Rex. He's a possum. I found him in the trash. He lives with us now.",Marshall
20132,I love him.,Lily
20133,"Lily, we are living with a possum. Rex is violent and he hates us.",Marshall
20134,"But, baby, you just lost your dad. None of us wants to upset you.",Lily
20135,"Please. If you guys really want me to get over the worst tragedy of my life, I'm begging you, tear me a new one. But not like Rex tried to in my sleep last night.",Marshall
20136,I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas.,Barney
20137,"J.J., I'm talking to Dad right now. God.",Barney
20138,"Seriously, it's time. What are my gaps?",Marshall
20139,"Well, I guess maybe one gap you have is... you can't wink.",Ted
20140,"Don't you think that maybe we should go home and, uh, &quot;do the laundry&quot;",Marshall
20141,You can't swallow pills.,Lily
20142,"Ooh, ooh, I got one. You think John Kennedy and Jack Kennedy are the same person<em>. (laughs</em>) Right? What?",Robin
20143,"Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.?",Barney
20144,"Oh, well, huh, now we all know you make excuses. I was talking about money.",Barney
20145,"Good time to get into print media. Am I right, Dad?",Barney
20146,"Uh, you don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj. Dad, check it. Triceps. What gym do you go to?",Barney
20147,"Sounds like you're having your fourth period. Am I right, Dad?!",Barney
20148,Why? J.J. started it. What does J.J. even stand for anyway? J... Jerky... Jerkface?,Barney
20149,Jerome Jr...? Oh. He's... he's named after you. Excuse me.,Barney
20150,You always add too much water to oatmeal.,Ted
20151,"Yes, I drown the son of a bitch.",Marshall
20152,You consistently miss at least one belt loop.,Robin
20153,It's like I'm blind.,Marshall
20154,You're too old to ask to see the cockpit.,Lily
20155,"Whoa. Whoa. Guys, my dad just died.",Marshall
20156,"Aw, honey.",Lily
20157,"No, I'm just kidding. This is great. I really, I really missed this.",Marshall
20158,This is mine.,Barney
20159,"J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me.",Barney
20160,"Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad.",Barney
20161,"Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?!",Barney
20162,"Oh, &quot;screwed up&quot; doesn't even begin to describe...",Barney
20163,Can you help me with this?,Barney
20164,Bye.,Barney
20165,Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?,Lily
20166,"I'm fine. Hey, Ted.",Barney
20167,"Yeah, buddy.",Ted
20168,"You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there?",Barney
20169,"Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine.",Ted
20170,"No, you were right. A kid needs a hoop.",Barney
20171,"Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner.",Barney
20172,Or maybe he was. Think about it. The way that she bats her eyelashes and shakes her tail feathers in his face? (chuckles) She wants it.,Robin
20173,Isn't it hard for you guys to be on opposite sides of something like this?,Lily
20174,"Of course you feel that way, Lily. You and Marshall have basically melded into one big hermaphroditic blob. And that's fine for you guys. But some of us want a partner who challenges us to grow and evolve.",Ted
20175,You guys are in screaming matches all the time.,Lily
20176,"Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Growing matches.",Ted
20177,The main character is a young spoiled prince thrust into leadership after the death of his father. It's obviously a modern-day retelling of Henry IV!,Ted
20178,"Okay, clearly, when we're watching Tommy Boy, we're watching two different movies.",Ted
20179,"No, you hang up.",Ted
20180,"No, you hang up.",Ted
20181,"No, you hang up! (<em>Later)</em> No, you hang up.",Ted
20182,"No, you... (His phone starts beeping) Hold on. (beep) Hello?",Ted
20183,"For the love of God, will one of you idiots hang up the phone?",Robin
20184,Why would you do that?!,Ted
20185,Who likes that?,Ted
20186,Your relationship sounds exhausting.,Lily
20187,"Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy.",Ted
20188,"Marshall and I have been together 15 years, and the only debate we've had about Tommy Boy is whether it's awesome or super awesome. That's love, bitch.",Lily
20189,I have to quit.,Marshall
20190,Quit GNB?! Why?,Barney
20191,"I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species...",Marshall
20192,"Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.",Barney
20193,"Baby, you have my full support.",Lily
20194,"Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning. (Barney snickers) Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids.",Barney
20195,I don't think you know what Spain is.,Robin
20196,"Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira.",Barney
20197,It's dinero.,Ted
20198,Where? I want his autograph!,Barney
20199,It's graduation goggles.,Robin
20200,What?,Marshall
20201,"Graduation goggles, like with high school. It's four years of bullies making fun of all the kids with braces, even after the braces come off and they can walk just fine. But then, on graduation day, you suddenly get all misty because you realize you're never going to see those jerks again. I just had graduation goggles with that guy Scooby I dated.",Robin
20202,The guy who was basically a dog?,Lily
20203,He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful. (as speaking to a dog): He was a good boy.,Robin
20204,"Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having sex with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it.",Barney
20205,"The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer.",Robin
20206,"You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.",Marshall
20207,"No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!",Barney
20208,"Baby, more than ever, you have my full support. <em>(Lily and Marshall kisses)</em>",Lily
20209,"You know, sometimes I feel bad for Lily and Marshall.",Ted
20210,I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey.,Lily
20211,It starts with an... &quot;L?&quot;,Barney
20212,It's like they never challenge each other. They just automatically agree all the time.,Ted
20213,"Yes, they do.",Ted
20214,"Yes, they do. It's like they...",Ted
20215,And I said my name was...?,Barney
20216,"Baby, I did it! I quit. And then I walked right over to the NRDC, and I took that job.",Marshall
20217,"Oh, good for you, sweetie.",Lily
20218,"Yeah. It's a little less money than I was expecting. I mean, compared to what I was making at GNB, it's nothing. Actually compared to anything, it's nothing. It's nothing. The paid position just got filled, so all I can do is-is volunteer right now. You're cool with that, right?",Marshall
20219,"Baby, if this is what you need to do, we'll figure it out. How's Barney handling you leaving?",Lily
20220,"Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play &quot;Who's Hot and Who's Scott?&quot;",Ted
20221,"It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall-... ruined everything.",Barney
20222,"Oh, come on. Everything's not ruined.",Ted
20223,What? Why?,Ted
20224,"...so, if the Landmarks Preservation Committee sides with Zoey, your whole project goes down the tubes? You must be furious.",Robin
20225,I'm furiously enjoying being challenged.,Ted
20226,Why don't you admit that your girlfriend challenging your every move is getting you a little m*rder?,Lily
20227,Why don't you admit that Marshall quitting his job and taking an unpaid internship is k*ll you?,Ted
20228,It's not.,Lily
20229,"Lily, the downside to having giant, Japanese anime eyes is that they're easy to read. And yours are screaming, &quot;What about my trip to Spain, b*at?&quot;",Ted
20230,"Okay, Ted, the downside to having a woman's mouth is, your feminine pout gives away your true feelings. And yours is saying, &quot;Oh, Zoey, why can't I be on top just this once?&quot;",Lily
20231,We take turns! Sometimes.,Ted
20232,"Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC.",Marshall
20233,I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.,Barney
20234,Hershel?,Robin
20235,"What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws.",Barney
20236,"Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker.",Lily
20237,There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games?,Barney
20238,"Barney, I'm not playing...",Marshall
20239,Just come back to GNB already!,Barney
20240,I'm really loving my new job.,Marshall
20241,"Oh, and I'm loving seeing you this happy.",Lily
20242,"I'm so glad to hear you say that because I volunteered our apartment for a big NRDC fund-raiser tomorrow night. You're-You're cool with that, right?",Marshall
20243,"Baby, you have my full support.",Lily
20244,"Thanks, baby. (<em>phone chirps)</em> Oh. Ooh, I gotta go. The invitations are ready. The party's for a bunch of environmentalists, so I found a guy downtown who makes biodegradable party invitations that can also be used as toilet paper.",Marshall
20245,That's how I'm gonna use mine.,Barney
20246,Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?,Robin
20247,"Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better.",Barney
20248,"Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?",Robin
20249,"Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. &quot;Barney, we have to talk about your father.&quot; &quot;Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil.&quot; &quot;Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session &quot;between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute.&quot; I don't need this!",Barney
20250,"Ah, Lily Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple! I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks. One: your mom didn't seem to mind it last night on her...",Ted
20251,"Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right? <em>(Ted says something in spanish)</em> Perfect. Let's go.",Lily
20252,"Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?",Barney
20253,"Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't.",Marshall
20254,"Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time.",Barney
20255,"<em>(Robin is standing at the door)</em> Oh, my God!",Robin
20256,How long have you been there?,Barney
20257,You don't remember?,Robin
20258,"Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.",Robin
20259,"Oh, no, I'm fine.",Barney
20260,"Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?",Robin
20261,"Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?",Barney
20262,Yeah.,Robin
20263,"Right. So, um... Chinese?",Barney
20264,"You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Marshall doesn't make us a worse couple.",Ted
20265,"You're right. I-If you and Zoey are happy, then who am I to judge? I'm so sorry.",Lily
20266,"Oh, my God, is that how support feels? It's so warm and wonderful. Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy.",Ted
20267,But I thought you liked being challenged.,Lily
20268,"Nobody likes being challenged! Couldn't she agree with me just once, even on something little, like... like what movie to see or-or what topping to get on our pizza or... oh, I don't know, my lifelong dream of building a skyscraper in New York City?!",Ted
20269,"Well, in her defense, hamburger pizza, Ted? What are you, 12?",Lily
20270,"You were right, Lily. I mean, Zoey's great, but... sometimes I do wish we were a little more like you and Marshall. There he is. Here we go. (<em>Ted says some incomprehensible things in spanish)</em>",Ted
20271,"Um, he speaks perfect English.",Ted
20272,"Yeah, I-I know.",Lily
20273,Then why did you ask me to come?,Ted
20274,"So you can drive him to the fund-raiser. Supporting Marshall this much is driving me crazy. I'm going to Spain-- my flight leaves in 45 minutes. Adios, muchacho.",Lily
20275,"W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain?",Ted
20276,"You were right. If I hear myself say &quot;Baby, you have my full support&quot; one more time, I swear I'm gonna m*rder someone!",Lily
20277,"What are you gonna tell Marshall, huh? And when are you coming back?",Ted
20278,"I honestly haven't thought it all the way through, and I don't intend to. All I know is that I'm a ticking time b*mb, and if I don't do something for me right away, I swear I'm gonna explode!",Lily
20279,"Wow, tha... that's an evocative metaphor to use for your nonthreatening, totally patriotic emotions. U.S.A.! Okay, Lily, I get it.",Ted
20280,Marshall's been asking a lot lately.,Lily
20281,But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough.,Ted
20282,"I've never been good at that. And now, ever since his dad died, I-I feel like it's my job to just be fine with everything. But I'm not. I'm not fine that he volunteers our apartment for a giant fund-raiser and that he's not thinking about how we're gonna pay any of our bills and that, apparently, we've given up on trying to have kids.",Lily
20283,Lil...,Ted
20284,"Look, I'm sorry, Ted, I just, I gotta do this. <em>(Lily leaves)</em>",Lily
20285,There's nothing to talk about.,Barney
20286,"You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.",Robin
20287,"I don't want to talk about it, okay?",Barney
20288,Why not?,Robin
20289,Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.,Barney
20290,"I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... (quietly): ticking.",Robin
20291,That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?,Barney
20292,"No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.",Robin
20293,Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.,Barney
20294,Huh?,Robin
20295,It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.,Barney
20296,"Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.",Barney
20297,"Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.",Marshall
20298,"I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...",Barney
20299,"...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted. (<em>quiet sobbing</em>) You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?",Barney
20300,What is wrong with you?,Robin
20301,"Hey, Professor Rodriguez, thank you so much for coming.",Marshall
20302,"Right over there. Enjoy. Hey. Hey, thanks for picking him up.",Marshall
20303,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, listen, something happened at the airport. Um...",Ted
20304,What?,Marshall
20305,"Well, we got there, and, uh, Lily...(<em>sighs)</em> Lily...",Ted
20306,"Marshall, hey. Sorry, I, uh, I had to park and-and grab some ice. Sorry.",Lily
20307,"Oh, thanks, babe. You would not believe how much this one has done to help throw this party, Ted. I don't know how she does it. Can't be easy, huh, Lil?",Marshall
20308,"Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I-I need to talk to you about something.",Lily
20309,"No, you know what? Me, too. Um... I want to thank you for being so supportive of me in all this. I've been at the NRDC for less than a week, and I've already done more to be proud of than in two years at GNB. I can't believe how good it feels. But now, it's time for me to find a way to help the Earth and get paid for it, because I can't put that burden entirely on you. So, starting tomorrow, I'll look for something with a paycheck. What do you think?",Marshall
20310,"Baby, you have my full support.",Lily
20311,Hey! What are you doing here?,Ted
20312,This you can be supportive of?!,Ted
20313,"I have the chance to build a skyscraper in the best city on Earth, and who's the one leading the charge to k*ll that dream? My girlfriend!",Ted
20314,You're too young. This isn't fair.,Lily
20315,"We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end.",Marshall
20316,"Yes, of course, of course... anything.",Marshall
20317,Eat this meatball sub.,Barney
20318,Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...,Marshall
20319,I don't have much time!,Barney
20320,"Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?",Marshall
20321,"Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas.",Ted
20322,What? That's... What is that word you taught me? &quot;Bull&quot; something?,Barney
20323,But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be... Led-and-Jerry.,Barney
20324,A drunk audience.,Barney
20325,Bye.,Barney
20326,"I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess.",Barney
20327,Mmm. Your dad?,Marshall
20328,My dad!,Barney
20329,Barney Stinson.,Barney
20330,"Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years.",Barney
20331,You do not know how right you are.,Barney
20332,Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything.,Barney
20333,"You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.",Ted
20334,"I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues.",Barney
20335,"Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.",Robin
20336,"Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?",Barney
20337,"Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.",Barney
20338,That's why you brought these guys.,Lily
20339,No. That's why I brought these guys. <em>(He gets several cards out of his inside pocket)</em> I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards.,Barney
20340,Improvements?!,Marshall
20341,Yeah.,Barney
20342,"Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards.",Marshall
20343,"Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage.",Barney
20344,Whoo-hoo!,Lily
20345,Gross!,Marshall
20346,"Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself. (chuckles) Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about.",Barney
20347,"Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, &quot;Man is least himself when he talks...&quot;",Ted
20348,"Ted, card.",Barney
20349,Ah. You're right... &quot;No quoting Oscar Wilde.&quot;,Ted
20350,"Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted.",Barney
20351,"Aw, man! Why?",Robin
20352,"I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh... (chuckles) no, thanks.",Barney
20353,"Hey, Barney... love the new identities. Little thing... instead of being a naked super ninja, can I be Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada?",Lily
20354,How good was that movie?,Ted
20355,And... hence new identities.,Barney
20356,"Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer.",Barney
20357,"Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet.",Marshall
20358,"Lily, his wife.",Barney
20359,"Well, most nights. Mama don't let no ring get in the way of a good time.",Lily
20360,"Uh, hi again. Ted. Oh, and, Jerry, you remember my girlfriend.",Ted
20361,Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.,Robin
20362,"Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band.",Barney
20363,"Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong...",Barney
20364,"Um, those places shut down a long time ago.",Marshall
20365,"Oh, no.",Barney
20366,"Oh, No shut down, too.",Marshall
20367,There's Where?,Ted
20368,"Where's where Was was, isn't it?",Lily
20369,"No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right?",Barney
20370,Not Okay. That place is lame.,Ted
20371,Okay is Lame? I thought Lame was a gay bar. Or is that Wrong?,Robin
20372,That's wrong. That's not Wrong.,Marshall
20373,"Guys, focus.",Barney
20374,"Oh, I like Focus. Let's go there.",Robin
20375,Where?,Ted
20376,Not Where. Focus.,Robin
20377,I thought Focus was closed.,Lily
20378,"No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed.",Barney
20379,So Closed is open.,Marshall
20380,"No, Closed is closed.",Robin
20381,"Ew, Third Base is all frat guys.",Robin
20382,Not Okay. Okay is lame.,Ted
20383,Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar.,Robin
20384,"Guys, shut up.",Lily
20385,"No, Shut up shut down. I can't believe I don't know the clubs anymore.",Barney
20386,"Guys, just pick a club, okay?",Marshall
20387,Not Okay!,Ted
20388,"For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced LamÃ©.",Marshall
20389,"It's hopeless, isn't it?",Barney
20390,Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters.,Marshall
20391,I know. Daddy's home. And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard!,Barney
20392,"Oh, my God, my secret crush is here.",Robin
20393,Mila Kunis?!,Lily
20394,"No, my secret crush. We met a few years ago.",Robin
20395,"Uh... no. <em>(laughs)</em> The only good thing about how ugly that shirt is, is that it distracts from how terribly it fits you.",Robin
20396,Oh. <em>(Laughs)</em>,Robin
20397,"I had to leave before we could finish talking, so that was it. You know, ever since then, I've always... Oh, my God, he's coming over here. Oh. Hello.",Robin
20398,"Oh, I'm sorry, you must have me confused with the shirt you were wearing that day.",Robin
20399,Hi! I'm Ted! Robin's boyfriend! Nice to meet you.,Ted
20400,"Mm-hmm. You, too.",Robin
20401,"Man, isn't this place great?",Barney
20402,And so bourgeois. Many of plays are about the bourgeois. And ennui. And one rock opera about... a frozen yogurt shop.,Marshall
20403,"Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk about your open marriage.",Barney
20404,"Okay. Well, after a long day of style meetings and photo sh**t and being way too mean to my assistant, I sometimes bang an underwear model.",Lily
20405,"I sleep around, too. Just as much. A little more, even.",Marshall
20406,"Oh, uh, only 'cause you have nothing to do all day.",Lily
20407,Are we having this fight again? Writing plays is a real job!,Marshall
20408,I work 90 hours a week subsidizing your &quot;real job.&quot;,Lily
20409,I won a Tony!,Marshall
20410,I brought French cooking to America!,Lily
20411,What?,Marshall
20412,Let's do shots.,Barney
20413,No. Don't you remember what you said to me when I was a kid? &quot;Never stop partying.&quot;,Barney
20414,"You don't remember the last thing you said to me when I was a kid? Well... you know, why don't you just go back home?",Barney
20415,"Yeah, well, I want to hang out with Crazy Jerry, not Stay-at-Home Jerome.",Barney
20416,Can you believe it? This is awesome!,Barney
20417,"Barney, how is that awesome?",Robin
20418,I finally know what it's like to be embarrassed by my dad.,Barney
20419,So you really believe that if we were in an open marriage that you would do better than me?,Marshall
20420,"Hey, you do better than me at a lot of other things, like digesting dairy... and reaching for stuff.",Lily
20421,So our usual wager. Deal.,Lily
20422,"Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y... you really want to be out here like this?",Barney
20423,"No, of course not. I... I just...",Barney
20424,"Yeah! Let's do it! Uh, maybe fix the tie. But mostly, party!",Barney
20425,"Okay, Jerry's gone; Let's break up.",Robin
20426,Okay. &quot;I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.&quot; There. What's the rush?,Ted
20427,"Well, that guy who came over here who thinks we're dating, I kind of have a crush on him. Can you help me clear it up?",Robin
20428,"Really? That guy? He was, like, a four.",Ted
20429,"A four? God, you are, like, the worst judge of guys ever. Okay, if he is a four, what are you?",Robin
20430,Hey! I'm not perfect; I'm an eight... and a half.,Ted
20431,You're a doofus and a half.,Robin
20432,Fine. Let's go talk to him. Where'd you meet this booger-eater anyway?,Ted
20433,At a close-out sale at Dawes.,Robin
20434,Really? I remember that sale.,Ted
20435,"Hey, Robin.",Ted
20436,"Oh, Ted. Oh, no.",Robin
20437,Look what I just bought. Right? Right? (He is wearing the Red Boots),Ted
20438,"Hold on. We were dating then. I specifically remember, because we had great sex that night. Great sex.",Ted
20439,Let me guess. Someone wants to knock... boots. Boots. <em>(imitating g*n)</em>,Ted
20440,Just take off your damn shirt. Okay.,Robin
20441,All right.,Ted
20442,"All right. Whoa, stop.",Robin
20443,What?,Ted
20444,Stop. Perfect.,Robin
20445,"But I... I can't see, and you can't see me.",Ted
20446,"Yeah. Yeah, just like that.",Robin
20447,You were picturing your crush!,Ted
20448,"Well, somebody had to.",Robin
20449,"Okay, okay, answer me this. Are you absolutely sure it had nothing whatsoever... to do with the boots?",Ted
20450,Yes.,Robin
20451,"(laughing): Hey, hey! There we go!",Barney
20452,Oh...!,Barney
20453,"It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So... next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special...",Barney
20454,What?,Barney
20455,But all those crazy things you did.,Barney
20456,A drunk audience.,Barney
20457,"No, no, no. You don't even know! Right here!",Barney
20458,Oh...!,Barney
20459,What just happened?,Barney
20460,"Well, why do all those things?",Barney
20461,You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy...!,Barney
20462,"Hey, you know, a... a pretty good magician like you probably knows how to, say, get out of a standard set of handcuffs.",Barney
20463,"Well, here's something you didn't know... I'm a pretty good magician, too. <em>(They escape and run away)</em> Abracadabra!",Barney
20464,"Oh, hey! Thank you so much. We're super excited. We're thinking June. (<em>laughs)</em> Yeah, okay. Okay, jerk, do you remember how you ended up buying those red cowboy boots?",Robin
20465,Do you have these in a size 11?,Ted
20466,"So get off the field at the Superdome, because you ain't no saint.",Robin
20467,Hello.,Marshall
20468,"I, uh... Oh.",Robin
20469,"Hi, Robin. Could I have your phone number?",Marshall
20470,We need someplace to hide.,Barney
20471,"No, Jerry, this is not the time to go to another club! We've got to get you back home in time for that trip. But there's no more trains, there's no cabs.",Barney
20472,Step on it! Jerry...,Barney
20473,"Jerry, we have got to get you home in time for that fishing trip.",Barney
20474,This is no time for laws!,Barney
20475,I am not going to buckle up!,Barney
20476,Hey! How's the open marriage going? Who was the first one to get the five numbers?,Ted
20477,I won that race. My prize... sex in the bathroom.,Lily
20478,And I won that race.,Marshall
20479,"Aw, sorry that secret crush didn't work out for you.",Lily
20480,"Oh, it's okay. I guess it just wasn't meant to be.",Robin
20481,Why are you smiling?,Lily
20482,I don't know. Good night.,Robin
20483,How did you do it?,Barney
20484,"How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but... I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs...",Barney
20485,"Hey, I'm trying to open up to you...",Barney
20486,"When I think about going for anything more than that, I look at my life, and who I am, and... I'm too far gone. I'm broken.",Barney
20487,So how do you do it?,Barney
20488,Maybe I've met her already.,Barney
20489,Maybe some other time.,Barney
20490,I'm going fishing with my dad.,Barney
20491,This... sucks.,Barney
20492,Yeah? And I'd sure love to give a rat's ass.,Marshall
20493,Your move.,Marshall
20494,Screw the environment!,Marshall
20495,"Sir, none of that is...",Marshall
20496,"Invitations for the demolition of The Arcadian. As head of the project, I get to decide how we knock it down. I'm torn between training an actual coyote to use an ACME dynamite plunger, or hooking up a fuse to Eddie Van Halen's guitar that goes off the second he hits the last note to &quot;Hot For Teacher.&quot; Barney! Barney! Bar... No, no. I'm going to go coyote.",Barney
20497,"Wait. While no one wants to see a, uh, coyote wearing a little hard hat more than me, remember: Zoey's protest could still shut your whole project down.",Robin
20498,"Oh, come on. Zoey's not shutting anything down, standing out there with her stupid megaphone, screaming in the wind; butt cheeks trembling with fury; her perky breasts heaving; her self-righteous nipples...",Barney
20499,"Dude, that's my girlfriend.",Ted
20500,"Point is, we are taking her and The Arcadian down. Am I right, Teddy Westside?",Barney
20501,You know it.,Ted
20502,"Okay. See, that's so weird to me. One second you're defending Zoey, and the next, you're talking about her going down.",Lily
20503,"Glad to know she's also mouthy in a good way. What up? Dude, that's his girlfriend.",Barney
20504,Isn't it tough dating the woman that's trying to prevent your building from being built?,Lily
20505,"At first, yes, but we figured out a great way to deal with it: we never talk about it. And since then, we've really been enjoying each other's company.",Ted
20506,"So, every time The Arcadian comes up, you guys just awkwardly change the subject?",Lily
20507,"Yeah, but you'd be surprised. It doesn't even come up that often.",Ted
20508,So Oprah's retiring. Oof! What's that world gonna be like?,Ted
20509,"Wait, Marshall's helping you save The Arcadian, now.",Robin
20510,"Yeah, totally.",Marshall
20511,"So, they found water on Mars. What?",Ted
20512,"Listen, um, I hate to go up against my two best friends, but... I really, I really need this right now. I mean, we're, we're cool, right?",Marshall
20513,"Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day?",Barney
20514,That was on purpose!,Lily
20515,I mean this is really like...,Barney
20516,"Barney, please...",Marshall
20517,Oh! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!,Marshall
20518,"Babe, can I get you a drink?",Lily
20519,"No, I'm still not... ready to put my mouth on anything yet.",Marshall
20520,I know.,Lily
20521,You know what? Screw this. Game on.,Marshall
20522,Can you believe this one? Wants our booth. Keeps giving us the walk-by.,Lily
20523,That bitch is not giving us the walk-by.,Robin
20524,The walk-by with the stink eye.,Lily
20525,Barney! Your wife just called from the hospital! It's a boy!,Marshall
20526,No. I' was... I was...,Barney
20527,"Pfff. Try 283. 250 was months ago. No, no, no. No, I mean, you're totally 250, baby. No, don't. <em>(The girl leaves)</em>",Barney
20528,"Oh, bye-bye.",Marshall
20529,"Mr. Stinson... I had to rush down as soon as I got your results. I'm sorry, but your crabs have super-herpes. <em>(The girl leaves in a hurry)</em>",Marshall
20530,"Oh, boy. Look who's back.",Lily
20531,"Look, Lily, I think this girl wants our seats. Should we leave... or stay here Lionel Richie style &quot;All Night Long&quot;?",Robin
20532,"Excuse me waitress, I'll have a mojito! And you'll have a no-seat-ho.",Lily
20533,"Ah, yes... the sweet, smoky taste of victory.",Marshall
20534,Are you sure it doesn't taste like anything else?,Barney
20535,That's it!,Marshall
20536,Kent! Kent!,Barney
20537,"Oh, God! Ow... Why would you do that to your own jacket?!",Marshall
20538,"That's what you get, you traitor!",Barney
20539,"Oh, really? Really?",Marshall
20540,Yeah. Really.,Barney
20541,Really. That... what...,Marshall
20542,Ejected!,Robin
20543,"Carl! Oh... This has nothing to do with us. You're totally ridiculous. <em>(The girls stand up and leave the booth; the other girl sits down at their booth)</em> Don't look, baby. Just don't look. Come on.",Robin
20544,"This stupid feud isn't going to end until Marshall and Barney finally talk about their feelings, cry, and then hug it out like they do on Oprah.",Lily
20545,"Man, what are we going to do without her?",Robin
20546,Oh...,Lily
20547,"Wait, you know what, these guys are not going to get all mushy sober. We need to get these bitches drunk.",Robin
20548,"Yes, but the right kind of drunk. Uh... we should go with something mellow. Maybe red wine?",Lily
20549,"Oh, I don't know. Red wine has kind of an odd effect on Barney. He reaches a point of sad clarity.",Robin
20550,"I'm a B-plus. My whole life, I was hoping to be an A, and I'm a B-plus. And I'm okay with that.",Barney
20551,"If we want them to open up, I say we go straight-up gin.",Robin
20552,Oh... last time Marshall got gin-drunk was at that douchey bar Barney likes to go to. Marshall almost got in a fight that night.,Lily
20553,"Look at this meatball. He's headed right towards me, showing me no respect. Well, if he wants to play chicken, this rooster ain't backing down! Oh. Mirror.",Marshall
20554,How about martinis?,Lily
20555,Absolutely not. I'm not going anywhere near you and a martini.,Robin
20556,Why not?,Lily
20557,"Ooh... You know what would be stupid? If we made out. That would be so stupid. Hey, I dare you guys to dare us to make out.",Lily
20558,Every time.,Robin
20559,I only say that because it would be so stupid if we did. So stupid...,Lily
20560,Uh-huh.,Robin
20561,"Oh, yeah? Well... what about you and absinthe?",Lily
20562,"I don't know. We could have water, soda, purple stuff...",Marshall
20563,We're a dream a baby's having. We're a dream a baby's having.,Robin
20564,"I keep telling you, that didn't happen.",Lily
20565,"It happened, and it changed me. How about daiquiris?",Robin
20566,Maybe. When Marshall has daiquiris... he gets really into how beautiful he is.,Lily
20567,"Hey, Marsh, you know that's another mirror, right?",Ted
20568,Peppermint schnapps?,Lily
20569,No. Peppermint schnapps turns Barney into Richard Dawson.,Robin
20570,Who?,Lily
20571,"The crazy old host of Family Feud, who greeted women by kissing them on the mouth.",Robin
20572,"Hey there, darlin'. How you doin'? Ah, is this your sister? Mmm... Beautiful. Mmm...",Barney
20573,"Hey, where are our chicken wings?",Ted
20574,Show me chicken wings!,Barney
20575,"Okay, I'm gonna go pick up Zoey, then we're off. See you Sunday.",Ted
20576,"Oh, wait, Ted. Do you have a specific reaction to any kind of alcohol?",Lily
20577,Bourbon. When I drink bourbon... I get weirdly good at b*at.,Ted
20578,"Peace, I'm out.",Ted
20579,"Yeah, Ted, I hate to tell you, but the bourbon only makes it sound good to you.",Lily
20580,Peace. I'm out.,Ted
20581,"You had to take that away from me, didn't you? <em>(He takes a bottle of Bourbon out of his bag and put it on the table)</em>",Ted
20582,"Well, enjoy Martha's Vineyard. Hopefully by the time you get back, we'll be allowed back into MacLaren's.",Robin
20583,What do you mean?,Ted
20584,Barney and Marshall's feud got us banned from the bar. We lost our booth.,Lily
20585,Stop.,Robin
20586,"Man, how did things get so screwed up?",Ted
20587,You and The Arcadian are ruining my life! What?,Ted
20588,"We're talking about this. Look, I can handle you trying to prevent me from fulfilling a life-long dream. That's just being in a relationship. But now? You turn my best friend against me?",Ted
20589,"Because he's going through a lot right now. He, he's looking for something to believe in, and you took advantage of that. You're, you're just like those Internet swindlers who tricked him into paying 300 bucks for a lock of Sasquatch fur.",Ted
20590,Okay. You know what? We're settling this once and for all.,Ted
20591,We've cross-referenced every alcohol with Marshall and Barney's reaction. What's the right drink for this situation?,Lily
20592,"Well, they're not talking. They're not even looking at each other. That reminds me of those awkward Sunday dinners with my mom, my dad and his mistress. Families, right?",Robin
20593,I-I guess. That... seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight.,Lily
20594,Do you know what I had to do to get you that job?,Barney
20595,Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day?,Marshall
20596,"What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like?",Barney
20597,I showed up with wet hair once! Once!,Marshall
20598,"Oh, my God.",Barney
20599,"Well, here we are. I had a reservation at a four-star inn overlooking the ocean but, uh... How can that compete with such a beautiful, magnificent hotel? Welcome to The Arcadian. So here's the deal. If you can last until sunrise in your precious Arcadian, I'll join your side.",Ted
20600,That's not a chocolate.,Ted
20601,"Okay, now we need to get them something that will make them emotionally vulnerable and completely, pathetically honest.",Robin
20602,"Yeah, we need a drink that, that takes subtext and turns it into text. Yeah.",Lily
20603,"See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation. That's why The Arcadian speaks to me.",Marshall
20604,"Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that...",Barney
20605,"Oh God, I didn't even think of that...",Marshall
20606,"It made me wonder, &quot;What could I have done to make him stay?&quot;",Barney
20607,"Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney.",Marshall
20608,That's what everyone keeps saying but people just keep leaving me.,Barney
20609,Wow. That got real o'clock.,Robin
20610,Yeah. We need to get them up and having fun.,Lily
20611,"Dance, my puppets, dance!",Robin
20612,Now do you see why I'm always interfering in other people's lives?,Lily
20613,"Oh, God, totally!",Robin
20614,"Dust just flew out of that comforter in the shape of a skull. Whoa, something just passed through me. Can you get STDs from the ghost of a prostitute?",Ted
20615,What are... What are you doing in our bathroom?,Ted
20616,Okay. Final round. What simple act will get the boys to finally forgive each other?,Lily
20617,"Sharing a brandy. Which is what I walked in on my parents doing once. Brandy was my father's mistress. God, parents. Right?",Robin
20618,"Again, just a whole other thing, sweetie. Where'd they go? Oh, no. They did shots.",Lily
20619,What? What is it?,Robin
20620,What's the worst thing they could possibly drink right now?,Lily
20621,Your place or mi... Your place or mi... Le-Let's go to your place. Mm.,Barney
20622,"Uh, these were supposed to be for a romantic dinner on our balcony as we were serenaded by the sounds of the ocean. But I guess we'll have to settle for what sounded like two very large men having sex next door... with a third very small man.",Ted
20623,"Okay. What is it? And don't give me, &quot;It's beautiful.&quot; Don't give me, &quot;It's magnificent&quot; What is it about this place that makes you so passionate to save it?",Ted
20624,"Why, why have you never told me that?",Ted
20625,I love you.,Ted
20626,"Well, what drink finally did the trick?",Robin
20627,I love you.,Marshall
20628,I love you.,Barney
20629,"Uh, no. N-Not right...",Barney
20630,"You know, I guess this place isn't so bad.",Ted
20631,What was what?,Ted
20632,I don't see anything.,Ted
20633,"Oh, my God! It's the cock-a-mouse!",Ted
20634,"Cock-a-mouse. Part cockroach, part mouse. It used to live in our apartment. It must have settled here, and... Oh! Look, it had babies! Good for it.",Ted
20635,"Be well, my friends! Aw, just how we left them.",Lily
20636,Morning. Who wants breakfast?,Robin
20637,You have some coffee? So I can throw it in this traitor's face?,Barney
20638,"Oh, yeah? Hey! Hey! Do you guys have some pancakes, because I... would really like some pancakes. They're fantastic. Let's be honest, I love them. But I hate this guy!",Marshall
20639,I thought they made up last night.,Lily
20640,"Damn it, I know what happened.",Robin
20641,I love you.,Marshall
20642,"I love you. Uh, no. N-not right...",Barney
20643,"Carl, a round of champagne.",Lily
20644,Ooh! The champagne.,Lily
20645,We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing.,Robin
20646,"What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?",Barney
20647,"Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too.",Ted
20648,"Whoa, whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Ted...",Barney
20649,"Okay, what drink can fix this?",Robin
20650,Mama's done with this drama. What drink can fix the headache these clowns are giving me?,Lily
20651,I got it.,Robin
20652,Right?,Robin
20653,Time is music the planets make. Music the planets make...,Lily
20654,"A symbol of strength and constancy, the stone lion of The Arcadian has watched over New Yorkers for generations. So remember: if the lion head stonework is regal, then tearing it down should be illegal. Well. Did you like that? All right, uh... We must make sure the lion is always there. Destroy The Arcadian? Oh, no, don't you dare. Yeah? Yeah? Okay. Try this one on for size... If you want New York's history at your beck and call...",Marshall
20655,I just have...,Marshall
20656,Wrecking ball. Don't go swinging no wrecking ball.,Marshall
20657,Thank you.,Marshall
20658,"&quot;Yes. The Arcadian should be a landmark.&quot; And then the crowd gasps: &quot;Oh, my God! Did he really just say that? Oh, heavens! Oh, my stars! I must clutch my pearls!&quot;",Ted
20659,"Almost exclusively. But here's my point: If they ask GNB's chief architect... aka me... if The Arcadian should be a landmark, and I say &quot;yes&quot;?",Ted
20660,"I'm sorry, I should have been more clear.",Marshall
20661,Nice.,Marshall
20662,I have a message from Barney.,Robin
20663,"Dude! That's my girlfriend. And ya know what? I'm on her side now, too.",Ted
20664,"Mmm. Love you, too.",Ted
20665,"All right, what's the message? 'Cause if it's another hypothetical yet eerily accurate drawing of my boobs...",Lily
20666,"Yeah, I have that, too.",Robin
20667,Damn it.,Lily
20668,"All right, here's the message. (<em>clears throat, then reads Barney's note)</em> &quot;Oh, hey, guys. Didn't see you there. I was too busy feelin' fine and...&quot; Really? &quot;Feelin' fine and gettin' some 'jine. You may have noticed the giant plate of hot wings in front of me. I know how much you love hot wings. Too bad someone bribed the kitchen to take them off the menu tonight. So, if you want some, you're going to have to come back to GNB. But hurry, this offer will be gone lickety-split. <em>(Barney licks his hot wings peace by peace then throws them down)</em> Do evil laugh.&quot; Oh, um... <em>(makes a poor impression of Barney's laugh)</em> So, what are you turds up to?",Robin
20669,"Oh, we've got the big LPC meeting in two days. I have my whole presentation worked out. I just need to find a good rhyme to end on.",Marshall
20670,Why does it need to rhyme?,Ted
20671,"If you end an argument with a rhyme, it's convincing all the time.",Marshall
20672,"Yeah. It's why in our apartment: If you're a-hopin' to score, don't leave your socks on the floor.",Lily
20673,And she hasn't since.,Marshall
20674,"Okay, okay. A couple of things. Lily, how'd I do?",Barney
20675,Nailed it.,Marshall
20676,"Secondly, Ted, I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey. Are you really going to walk away from this project just because you're mad at me?",Barney
20677,"It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been dead for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands.",Ted
20678,I understand. Zoey has magic lady bits.,Barney
20679,What?,Ted
20680,"Zoey's lady bits... are magic, and that's how she controls your mind. You see, every few hundred millennia, lady bits leap forward...",Barney
20681,"I know you're only just getting started, but this is already gross.",Lily
20682,I once knew such a girl.,Barney
20683,It was last call. In this very bar.,Barney
20684,What...?! No... What?!...No... What?!,Barney
20685,"Um... thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story.",Robin
20686,"Barney, this is about the building.",Ted
20687,Come on. This is so about the girl.,Barney
20688,"Okay, fine. It's about the girl! I am doing this for Zoey! I'm in love with her. Look, I know it's early, but there is a very good chance Zoey might be the mother of my children. So, in addition to doing this for John Clifford Larrabee, I'm also doing this for Luke and Leia.",Ted
20689,Wait. She's gonna let you name your kids Luke and Leia?,Lily
20690,"Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't. Barney, I'm sorry.",Ted
20691,"Oh, you're not sorry now, Ted Mosby. But you will be. You... will... be. (laughing harder and louder) That's how you do an evil laugh. Ciao for now.",Barney
20692,"Hi, Arthur. Everything okay?",Barney
20693,Isn't that animal cruelty?,Barney
20694,"Oh. That's fine, then. So listen, you know Ted, the architect?",Barney
20695,"So, if Ted stood up at that big meeting tomorrow and said that he thought The Arcadian should be a landmark... You wouldn't just fire him, would you? <em>(laughing uncomfortably)</em> Right? You wouldn't just... You wouldn't just... yeah...",Barney
20696,Come again for Big Fudge?,Barney
20697,"Can you believe that?! I can't be unemployed, Robin! My job is my identity; It's who I am. It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot.",Barney
20698,I-I don't understand. Why would he fire you?,Robin
20699,I don't understand. Why would you fire me?,Barney
20700,By being the best architect available?,Barney
20701,By... being Latino?,Barney
20702,"Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, fire me.",Barney
20703,Damn it! I was kidding?,Barney
20704,"I'm not kidding! Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife?",Barney
20705,They're going to fire him? That sucks. He loves that job.,Ted
20706,And he's been doing it for years.,Marshall
20707,"Okay, what does Barney do at GNB?",Lily
20708,No idea.,Ted
20709,He has a lot of keys.,Marshall
20710,"Okay, Ted, can you just please think about this before you...",Robin
20711,There's nothing to think about. I-I can't lose Zoey. That's the only thing that matters to me right now.,Ted
20712,"Okay, Ted... you know I love Zoey. But, look, sometimes... I go play chess in the park. And the key to chess... Okay, I play online. But the key to chess... Okay, it's Angry Birds! But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario.",Robin
20713,The chairman asks you...,Robin
20714,You say...,Robin
20715,No.,Ted
20716,And Zoey dumps you on the spot.,Robin
20717,There's the second scenario.,Robin
20718,The chairman asks you...,Robin
20719,You say...,Robin
20720,Yes,Ted
20721,"And you're happy for, like, a second, until you realize the building you helped save has just become a monument to everything this woman made you give up, and you resent her for it, so much so, in fact, that you dump her.",Robin
20722,We're done here.,Ted
20723,You said there was a third scenario.,Ted
20724,Right.,Robin
20725,The chairman asks you...,Robin
20726,But before you can answer...You're hit in the neck with a blow dart fired by the ninja Zoey's ex-husband hired to assassinate you.,Robin
20727,That one's less likely. What I'm saying... what I hate saying... is this. You and Zoey are gonna break up. But you can still save your career and Barney's.,Robin
20728,"Okay, first of all, no ninja's getting a jump on me. I have the reflexes of a jungle... <em>(Robin slaps him by surprise)</em>",Ted
20729,Tree?,Lily
20730,"Second of all, I don't care that the odds are stacked against us. I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey than spend the rest of my life alone playing Angry Birds, which, by the way, I've shown you how to download, like, 20 times.",Ted
20731,"I've got to say, I'm with Ted on this.",Lily
20732,Thank you.,Ted
20733,"I mean, yes, this is a huge, divisive issue for them. Which means no matter what happens, there's gonna be a lot of resentment. Probably lasting for years... infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship. So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this.",Lily
20734,Thank you.,Robin
20735,"Barney, what are you doing?",Ted
20736,Really? 'Cause it feels more like my insane friend renting a costume and breaking into my apartment in the middle of the night for what I wish I could say was the first time.,Ted
20737,"Barney, there's condoms in the drawer. Just take them and get out.",Ted
20738,Whoa! Lighting change!,Ted
20739,"Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building, but... does that mean we have to knock it down? I mean, it's not bothering anyone. Just anyone who lives in it... Or looks at it... Or smells it.",Ted
20740,"The Arcadian has to go, doesn't it?",Ted
20741,You realize this kind of screws up my personal life.,Ted
20742,"This is a dream, right? Because, Barney, I swear to God, if that's you...",Ted
20743,"&quot;Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair&quot;&quot;",Ted
20744,Right. And I mistook you for a prostitute right... here.,Ted
20745,Worth every penny.,Ted
20746,"No, we should get some sleep. But this was fun.",Ted
20747,Exactly.,Ted
20748,Yeah. Good night.,Ted
20749,"No, it shouldn't be a landmark. There are a lot of important buildings in New York. The Arcadian isn't one of them.",Ted
20750,"Yeah, that's me.",Ted
20751,"This is a nightmare. I can't believe she kept that tape. The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow, and based on today...",Ted
20752,They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place.,Robin
20753,Yeah.,Ted
20754,"We'll end up out of a job, all thanks to some stupid, only sort of awesome lion head.",Barney
20755,"Better get used to that lion head. As of tomorrow, it's gonna be there till the end of times. And all because of my sweet, sweet rhymes.",Marshall
20756,What are we gonna do? We should buy a bar.,Ted
20757,We should totally buy a bar!,Barney
20758,We should absolutely totally buy a bar!,Marshall
20759,It's really the only sensible idea right now.,Robin
20760,"Oh, oh, and ready? It's a theme bar. It's a courtroom.",Marshall
20761,Yes! Where the bartenders wear sexy judges' robes.,Ted
20762,I'll allow it!,Marshall
20763,"The only court where you show up, then get served.",Barney
20764,Ho! You're judged by a jury of your beers.,Robin
20765,That's not bad.,Ted
20766,Just stop it! No one's buying a bar. Right now we have a little problem. Let's just think of a solution.,Lily
20767,"Lily, it's over. The good guys lost.",Ted
20768,"I don't know, homegirl is pretty diabolical. If there is a plan that'll get us out of this, it's somewhere inside this butter churn. She'll think of it. I'm just gonna sit here... and watch it happen. <em>(Lily starts to jiggle)</em> And she's got it! Lily, what's the plan?",Marshall
20769,"Oh, this ought to be good.",Barney
20770,"Oh, this is good!",Barney
20771,We have to find Arthur right now.,Ted
20772,"Hey, Arthur!",Barney
20773,"Oh, cute dog!",Robin
20774,"Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea for how we can save, not saving The Arcadian.",Barney
20775,"Uh... Hey, Arthur?",Barney
20776,"Okay, first hear my demands. One, Ted and Barney keep their jobs. Two, when you guys do finally blow up The Arcadian, one of them gets to push the button.",Lily
20777,Well...,Lily
20778,Zoey... Zoey!,Ted
20779,I don't know. Sometimes... things have to fall apart to make way for better things.,Ted
20780,"Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore. You may now say what you really think of Zoey.",Ted
20781,"I don't know, she may have been right about that lion's head. It gave The Arcadian a regal elegance. Then again, it goes really nice with my duvet. <em>(He takes out a normal size screw driver)</em> I hope I used the right screws.",Barney
20782,I want to press the button to blow up The Arcadian!,Ted
20783,I want to press it!,Barney
20784,I want to press it!,Ted
20785,I want to press it!,Barney
20786,"Guys, I dated you both, and neither of you is good at pressing or even finding the button. After some awkward pawing around, that building's going to fake an implosion, say, &quot;Baby, that was great&quot;&quot; and go to sleep.",Robin
20787,"It's just a button, okay? Can we just talk about something else, please?",Robin
20788,"Well, I ran into Zoey yesterday.",Ted
20789,That's the first time since the breakup. How's she doing?,Robin
20790,Saving money. Making new friends. No downside.,Ted
20791,"Well, I can tell you're really busy so I should... I'll let you go.",Ted
20792,You know that &quot;coffee&quot; is code for &quot;I want to get back together&quot; right?,Robin
20793,"Well, at first I wasn't sure, but then she said something that got me thinking.",Ted
20794,"Don't worry, we're not. I just, I feel bad Zoey's having such a hard time.",Ted
20795,"You know what might... make you feel better, buddy?",Barney
20796,I'm not letting you press the button.,Ted
20797,I want to press the button!,Barney
20798,You're not pressing the button! It's my button!,Ted
20799,"He's out printing out a whole new batch of rÃ©sumÃ©s because he misspelled the phrase &quot;detail-oriented.&quot; And when he gets back home, he is going to find his favorite soup there waiting for him.",Lily
20800,"Oh, that's sweet, Lil, but didn't you guys get food poisoning here one time?",Robin
20801,"Three times. But they're really nice about it. Their policy is, &quot;Get sick, get a free gallon of soup&quot;.",Lily
20802,"This is Mr. Buttons 2. Now, after what happened to Mr. Buttons 1, we have to be very gentle with... <em>(Lily throws up onto Mr. Buttons 2. She leaves the shool, running to her apartment in order to stop Marshall from eating the soup)</em> Marshall! Don't eat the soup! Oh, thank God.",Lily
20803,This was about to be my third bowl. Why shouldn't I eat the soup? Why shouldn't I eat the soup?,Marshall
20804,"Hey, Mr. Architect, big day for you tomorrow, huh?",Robin
20805,Yeah. Getting to stand next to me while I press the button. That is going to be legend... wait for it...dary adjacent. Legendary adjacent!,Barney
20806,You okay?,Robin
20807,Yeah... no. This morning I was talking to the foreman.,Ted
20808,"You know, Rod, um, I'm loving that nickname, and I can tell it's totally affectionate, but, uh, I'd prefer Ted.",Ted
20809,"50,000 lightbulbs! What if this one's too bright? What if this one flickers and gives everyone a weird headache? Do you know how many people it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs?",Ted
20810,"Are these people Irish, Polish, blondes... what are we dealing with here?",Barney
20811,There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks?,Ted
20812,Not possible. Your building is new. And I have one rule: New is always better.,Barney
20813,You can't keep saying you have one rule if they're always different rules.,Ted
20814,"Ah, but &quot;new is always better&quot; is my oldest rule, which makes it the best.",Barney
20815,"Hi, Marsh.",Ted
20816,"Oh, hey, buddy.",Barney
20817,Hey. Everything okay?,Robin
20818,"Lily got food poisoning from some soup. And then I ate the soup exactly three hours later. Which means I can see exactly three hours into my future, and it... doesn't... look... good. I tried to be supportive.",Marshall
20819,"Oh, baby, can you just hold me, please?",Lily
20820,"Of course, baby. <em>(He hesitates, then put one finger onto her back)</em>",Marshall
20821,"But it doesn't help it that when Lily gets going; she sounds like a velociraptor from Jurassic Park. But then I realized a man can do a lot of living in three hours. So, I'm out experiencing this beautiful, crazy dance called life. Ah, my last meal. MacClaren's famous jalapeno poppers. My doctor says I need to eat healthier, so I figured the round-trip flight these babies are about to take will land them permanently on the no-fry list. Good-bye, my friend. It's been a hell of a ride. I have to...",Marshall
20822,"Hey, babe. The gang says feel better.",Marshall
20823,"Mm. Thanks. Wait, you didn't tell them I had food poisoning, did you?",Lily
20824,"Um, I...",Marshall
20825,"Marshall, when it's stomach stuff, you just say &quot;under the weather,&quot; or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things.",Lily
20826,I know. I just said that you had the sniffles. No one is picturing anything but little red-nosed you under a blankie with some hot tea.,Marshall
20827,I wonder what end it's coming out of Lily right now.,Barney
20828,I bet it's her tushie.,Robin
20829,"I bet it's both. Hey, speaking of explosions... enough already, Ted! That button's mine!",Barney
20830,"I got you this job, so I... Say what?",Barney
20831,Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run. <em>(Ted leaves the Bar)</em>,Ted
20832,You...,Barney
20833,Why would Ted just give up the button like that? And he forgot his phone. &quot;See you in an hour.&quot;,Robin
20834,Who's that from?,Barney
20835,Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her!,Robin
20836,Why would Ted get back together with Zoey? He's doing great.,Barney
20837,"After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back.",Robin
20838,"No, I refuse to believe that Ted is getting back with Zoey because of lightbulbs.",Barney
20839,"Uh, Ted's gone back for less.",Robin
20840,"Hi, Natalie. You want to get coffee sometime?",Ted
20841,Bro.,Ted
20842,"Ted, I only have one rule.",Barney
20843,"But I can't reach the worst part. <em>(He picks his phone and calls someone)</em> Hi, Karen. Want to get coffee sometime?",Ted
20844,"Robin, you want to get coffee sometime...?",Ted
20845,"Get it together, bro.",Robin
20846,"According to my calculations, at 6:00 p.m., my body is gonna pay out like the most disgusting slot machine in the world. That gives me two hours to go do the interview and still get back in time.",Marshall
20847,"Oh, but, baby, what if you hit the jackpot early?",Lily
20848,Don't worry. I'll be prepared.,Marshall
20849,Can... I... borrow... an adult diaper?,Marshall
20850,We've got to stop Ted. Where are they meeting?,Barney
20851,"Okay, Zoey wrote, &quot;Meet me at 6:00, where it all began, where you gave me the orchid at the intersection.&quot;",Robin
20852,"Well, that's good. All we have to do is think back to the time Ted told us about his first date with Zoey.",Barney
20853,Amazing first date with Zoey! We met at the intersection... <em>(The rest is unintelligible)</em>,Ted
20854,"Aw, that's sweet.",Robin
20855,You weren't listening either?,Barney
20856,"I was in a coma. I mean, who pays attention to that sappy romantic crap?",Robin
20857,"Yeah, I wasn't listening, either. Ted really can go on about a bitch.",Lily
20858,Great. He could be anywhere. We're flat out of clues.,Robin
20859,"Hey, wait. Ted left a message. I could hear it 'cause I was in the bathroom... blowing my nose... I have the sniffles.",Lily
20860,"Damn it, Marshall.",Lily
20861,"Okay, we're never gonna find him.",Robin
20862,"Wait, wait, wait. That's was a subway announcement in the background. I speak conductor.",Lily
20863,Got it. Ted's at... <em>(Lily runs to the bathroom and throws up)</em> Oh... Ted's at Smith and Ninth Street.,Lily
20864,That's the intersection.,Barney
20865,That's in Brooklyn. How are we ever gonna get there in time?,Robin
20866,Way ahead of ya.,Barney
20867,"Hello, hi.",Marshall
20868,I can't believe Ted's getting back together with Zoey.,Robin
20869,I know. They're a total train wreck.,Barney
20870,Unmitigated disaster.,Robin
20871,"Yeah, almost as bad as us.",Barney
20872,"We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched.",Robin
20873,"What about me? I got so fat, at the end of a date, you'd unhook my bra.",Barney
20874,You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated.,Robin
20875,"Thank God we're not sentimental saps who panic and get back together. Seriously, why would people do that?",Barney
20876,I guess I get it.,Robin
20877,What do you mean?,Barney
20878,"Well, no matter how bad things got... Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he?",Robin
20879,"Yeah... he did. And... she loved him, too. Didn't she?",Barney
20880,"Yeah, she did.",Robin
20881,That's a seal.,Marshall
20882,Mm-hmm.,Marshall
20883,"Okay, where the hell are they?",Robin
20884,Maybe this isn't the intersection.,Barney
20885,"Well, maybe it is and we're too late. Man, I wish we'd gone to Brooklyn sooner.",Robin
20886,"Wait. Where'd you get that? <em>(The guy is holding a cup, on which is printed &quot;The Intersection&quot;)</em>",Robin
20887,She's alone! There's still time! But where the hell is Ted?,Barney
20888,"Wait a minute. On their first date, he brought her an orchid. How much do you want to bet he's gonna do it again?",Robin
20889,"Brilliant. But wait, he had a huge head start on us. There's no way he's still in there unless he spent a half an hour picking out the perfect orchid.",Barney
20890,A pile of rotting seagull carcasses covered in toxic sludge.,Marshall
20891,"When it's stomach stuff, you just say &quot;under the weather&quot; or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things.",Lily
20892,I have food poisoning and I'm about to start volcanoing toxic sludge out of both ends! <em>(Marshall leaves in a hurry)</em>,Marshall
20893,Nailed it.,Lily
20894,"Thanks, Julia! No, on second thought. <em>(Barney and Robin jumps on him, all three fall down)</em>Ooh! Come on. What the hell?!",Ted
20895,You can't get back together with Zoey just because you're freaking out over a lightbulb.,Robin
20896,"I'm not freaking out over a lightbulb! I'm freaking out over 50,000 lightbulbs! I can't do this! I only got this job because you gave it to me, Barney. I didn't earn it!",Ted
20897,"Look, Ted, the future is scary. But you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar. Yes, it's tempting.",Robin
20898,But... it's a mistake.,Barney
20899,"You're right. <em>(Ted stops an elderly woman who was about to enter the Intersection)</em> Um, excuse me. Can you give this to the blonde sitting alone in there and tell her Ted's really sorry? Also... indirect sunlight. Don't overwater. Half a cup a week is more than enough. <em>(The elderly woman enters and gives theflowers to a blonde sitting alone, but not the right one)</em> No. Hi.",Ted
20900,"Hey, baby, how'd it go?",Lily
20901,"Lily, this year, this nasty schoolyard bully of a year will not stop punching me in the face. How did we kick off 2011? My dad died. And now after five months of unemployment, I just blew my dream job. The good news is, in a few seconds, I'm gonna start heaving my guts out because that's what life is for me now: just losing what's inside until I'm just empty.",Marshall
20902,"Baby, come here.",Lily
20903,I just want to shut my eyes for a few seconds before it starts. <em>(He lyes down onto the bed and falls asleep)</em>,Marshall
20904,He is.,Barney
20905,You sure?,Ted
20906,Yeah. You earned it.,Barney
20907,"Hey, new is always better, right?",Ted
20908,Always.,Barney
20909,"Lily, it's a miracle. I didn't get sick. I didn't get sick.",Marshall
20910,"I know, baby. I'm pregnant.",Lily
20911,I'm proud of you for giving Ted the button. It meant a lot.,Robin
20912,"It's just a button. Can we talk about something else, please? (<em>Barney sees Norah, Robin says something to him that we can&quot;t hear, then Barney walks up to Norah)</em> Norah.",Barney
20913,How you been?,Barney
20914,"Look, I don't know why you would possibly say yes to this, but would you want to grab a cup of coffee with me sometime? 20 minutes. I was such a jerk to you. You can spend the entire time calling me every dirty name in the book.",Barney
20915,"I'll call you. You look beautiful, by the way. And here I thought it was too late for sundresses.",Barney
20916,Challenge accepted.,Barney
20917,Best man? You're being summoned.,Lily
20918,"Geez, what now? <em>(He goes inside, enters a room)</em> I heard the groom needed me.",Ted
20919,What do you think of this tie?,Barney
20920,What do you think of this tie?,Barney
20921,"Thank you, God. Barney Stinson needs you just before her marriage, is that there must be a dead prostitute in the closet, right?",Ted
20922,This one is better?,Barney
20923,"The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage.",Ted
20924,"I'm not scared. It's just that I think once I'd put this tie, I could never remove it. I should wear it again and again. And of course this tie is fine now, but how I will cope when it becomes big and it annoy me? Do I made a mistake? Is what I would have been happier with the other tie? Ted, I can tell you a big secret?",Barney
20925,"Yeah, sure.",Ted
20926,I do not really talk about the tie.,Barney
20927,"Yeah, I realized that Barney.",Ted
20928,I wonder if this will be a disaster. And if it was the worst of all marriage?,Barney
20929,Impossible. It has already been the worst of all marriage.,Ted
20930,That of Punchy.,Barney
20931,Marshall has really ruined all that.,Ted
20932,Hi. Guys before you go that you bother to read my toast for the wedding?,Ted
20933,"Yeah, no problem, of course.",Barney
20934,Ok,Ted
20935,Woow.,Barney
20936,There are several different versions.,Ted
20937,"Ted, why you work so hard on this speech? Punchy has applied with a karaoke microphone in a bowling alley.",Robin
20938,"Ok, I have never said that, but over the years, some of my friends from high school asked me to give speeches at their weddings, and they have not gone well.",Ted
20939,"These marriages have become associated as the worst moment of my life. The love between Joel and Mora is magnificent. I thought I had the same thing... Until my fiancee left me at the altar last week. I was asked not to talk about that, so I will not do. I sit in front of her home at night sometimes. It changed hairstyle. (In 2009...) After losing my job last week, I asked not to give this toast... (A man tries to take her microphone) No, no, no! The happy couple should hear. It's over. But from the ashes of your divorce statistically probable, hope can be reborn. That is why I opened my own architectural firm Mosbius Designs. (3 months later...) Mosbius Designs went bankrupt. But the love of Alex and Jessica reminds us that... Oh, my God!",Ted
20940,Wow. Punchy has posted weaknesses of your life?,Robin
20941,"Oh, not that much. Now I am a total disaster for all my old high school friends. And a lot of people in Finland are the big stuff. This is why I have to type this toast.",Ted
20942,"Ted, you can hit you something else to this marriage.Let the big binder. The only thing you have to bring it to Cleveland.",Barney
20943,"Here's your speech. &quot;In single file, girls. No big. &quot;",Barney
20944,This is ridiculous.,Ted
20945,"Yeah, you're right. This is Cleveland. &quot;In single file, girls. &quot;",Barney
20946,I will not Punchy's wedding to brag... cover of a magazine.,Ted
20947,"Barney, he did not need your advice. You never called Nora.",Robin
20948,I'll call you.,Barney
20949,Or you called? It's not that I want to know. So what? I do not care. You did?,Robin
20950,I did not call.,Barney
20951,"Slim, Barney. I was really, really, really for both of you.Who wants chicken wings?",Robin
20952,"Me. Or maybe we should make the hot sauce on Barney, now that's a sissy.",Lily
20953,"I'm not a wimp. Nora wanted a professional. Not me.That's it. And yes, Robin, I want chicken wings.",Barney
20954,Cannibal.,Lily
20955,"Ok, next tour for me.",Robin
20956,"Oh no, no, it does that.",Marshall
20957,I can not wait to tell everyone.,Marshall
20958,"Baby, no one can tell anyone. Not before three months. I do not want you to have bad luck.",Lily
20959,"It's a bit superstitious, do not you think?",Marshall
20960,"Whenever you take a plane, you lick.",Lily
20961,Has it been crashed once?,Marshall
20962,Do not say a word until we know that all is well. Ok?,Lily
20963,"Ok, so everything will be okay. Promised.",Marshall
20964,How can you guarantee that?,Lily
20965,I'm so happy. I do not know how we will keep this secret for three months.,Marshall
20966,Relax. It will be easy.,Lily
20967,"Four beer, plus a non-alcoholic.",Lily
20968,"Stand ready, Cleveland. The last guy who has conned you so hard and then disappeared was LeBron James.",Barney
20969,You're going to try to make you anybody here?,Robin
20970,What?,Barney
20971,"My God, Barney, tonight is a magical night between the annoying friend of Ted and that is what this-face. A little respect.",Robin
20972,"It's not just be someone. This is a market survey. You see, my legendary success rate of 83%...",Barney
20973,17. He always reverse.,Ted
20974,"... never happens by accident. Each technique used to drag a woman has been thoroughly field tested. By eliminating improper techniques in small markets like Cleveland. I know which will go to New York. For example, tonight marks the inauguration of the escaped prisoner. Do prisoners on the run are sexy?",Barney
20975,We'll never know unless I try tonight.,Barney
20976,You really feel this ring now.,Marshall
20977,"Oh, no, thank you.",Lily
20978,"Let's be crazy! You're going to drink for two tonight, baby.",Lily
20979,I'll do it for the child.,Marshall
20980,"During the season of super bowl, but if they mean the super bowl. Go Vikings.",Marshall
20981,"Prisoners on the run are not sexy. At the same time it was a faulty concept. Next step, the patient zero.",Barney
20982,"Lily, you go getting drunk tonight.",Robin
20983,"That's all you, baby.",Lily
20984,I'd to 4 glasses without eating.,Marshall
20985,In nine months I would push a baby Eriksen with a pumpkin head out of my hoo-haa. I think Dad can handle a few cocktails and more.,Lily
20986,Well done.,Marshall
20987,Hakuna Matata!,Lily
20988,I gotta go get some air.,Marshall
20989,"My God, have you seen this guy. I want Barney is my new boyfriend. No, thank you.",Robin
20990,Wait a minute. It's your voice of truth.,Lily
20991,My what?,Robin
20992,"Whenever you try to pretend that you're kidding but in fact it is profoundly true, you are using that voice.",Lily
20993,I would like the Spice Girls back together. They were awesome. The worst. (At the bar...) It was me. I farted. It is this type. (At Ted's apartment...) birthday gift from my father. All I want from him is that he tells me he loves me. Just kidding.This pen is sufficient. It's enough. It is completely sufficient.,Robin
20994,"Oh, my God. You always have feelings for Barney. Admit it, you still have feelings for Barney.",Lily
20995,"You're more drunk than I thought. I mean, look at this type.",Robin
20996,"Wait, wait, wait, before you leave, please do respond to this survey to help me better to seduce you in the future.What does not work for you in this game of seduction? Does A do not you think that I hold a bailiff of the world? B or fingernails disgusts you? (He shows her nails, very long and the girl goes away) Sea...",Barney
20997,Wait. You encourage me to cry at your own wedding?,Ted
20998,"Take that. Shows them how much you're great. Say your ad, not ashamed, say that.",Barney
20999,"I've told you, I'm not here to brag, ok?",Ted
21000,"That's it. You're too polite to brag. Well, fine. Let me do it. Because the only person on Earth who loves more than Ted Mosby Marshall Eriksen Marshall Eriksen is drunk. So here we go.",Marshall
21001,Barney and I have tried and failed. It was there two years. Why would I start? It would not make sense.,Robin
21002,"It does not make sense. It's chemistry. Listen, I always them a sixth sense for these things. And now that I'm pregnant... deep in me in my uterus, I see things more clearly. You and Barney have that kind of chemistry that is still there.",Lily
21003,Really? That's why he tries to Lebron anything that moves?,Robin
21004,"It does not work for you because A vampires are offside, B or pretend that I invented Facebook was a bit too?",Barney
21005,You're the reason why he never called Nora. You're the reason why he only tests tonight. And you're the reason why he continues to try to impress. Chemistry.,Lily
21006,"Wow! Ted! It's really you on the cover of New York.Now, you say &quot;yes.&quot;",Marshall
21007,Stop please.,Ted
21008,"You know what, Clay? It's nothing.",Ted
21009,"You know what? This is not nothing. Clay, my friend Ted has designed a building, Clay. What do you do, Clay?",Marshall
21010,"Hear, hear, Clay. No major publication does write about your small agency?",Marshall
21011,"Oh my God, look at this little baby. She's so cute. All I want is to put her little feet in my mouth. You have created something really beautiful.",Marshall
21012,"I mean, it's still huge... The building, you know?",Ted
21013,"Hey, kid. (With another couple and their child...) So this little angel is already every night?",Marshall
21014,I spent many sleepless nights... to design this building.(The baby makes a return to the magazine) Nothing symbolism there.,Ted
21015,Forget it. There is no chemistry between Barney and me. It's over.,Robin
21016,Oh really? Prove it. Go talk to him.,Lily
21017,Why should I tell him about that?,Robin
21018,"Because in the depths of himself, even if he does not know yet, Barney wants to be with you. And if it does not happen, he deserves to know.",Lily
21019,"Well. Barney, just to make things clear...",Robin
21020,"I know what you gonna say. Show in Cleveland, how it goes.",Barney
21021,Barney... I...,Robin
21022,"Sorry. Oh, my God, this is Nora. She finally ended up reminding me.",Barney
21023,"Wait, you said you'd never recalled.",Robin
21024,"I lied. I called, like, five times. Wait, wait! You guys you know better than anyone how I show this stuff. Will you help me please? I would like just once to see what it feels like when you do not quite fair.",Barney
21025,Yeah.,Robin
21026,Hi Nora. Thank you for reminding me. The reason I'm calling...,Barney
21027,To tell you how I feel.,Robin
21028,To tell you how I feel.,Barney
21029,I know it did not work the first time...,Robin
21030,I know it did not work the first time...,Barney
21031,... and it makes no sense...,Robin
21032,... and it makes no sense...,Barney
21033,... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.,Robin
21034,... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.,Barney
21035,Is there a part of you that wants to try again?,Robin
21036,Is there a part of you that wants to try again?,Barney
21037,"Baby, I can not do that. I have to tell someone that we are pregnant.",Marshall
21038,"Eriksen, be strong. Keep it a secret.",Lily
21039,There are babies everywhere. It's minefield of sweetness. Look at this little bastard.,Marshall
21040,"Marshall, stop that. Remains strong. Can not you let me hold a little baby with his little cheeks... so cute... and little arms and little legs... This little bastard has dimples. We will tell everyone I'm pregnant.",Lily
21041,Yeah!,Marshall
21042,Are you okay?,Ted
21043,No. And you?,Robin
21044,Not really. Want to talk?,Ted
21045,Not even a little bit.,Robin
21046,It might help you feel better.,Ted
21047,"Okay, well, we'll make a deal. You go first and then I still do not tell you what's wrong.",Robin
21048,"Okay. All my friends from high school, are there with their wives and children. And me? My appointment is a dirty magazine.",Ted
21049,"As in high school. Sorry, I had to.",Robin
21050,"I've always believed in fate, you know? I will go in a magazine Bagel, I would see a pretty girl in the queue reading my favorite novel, whistling the song I had all week in my head, and I would think, &quot;Wow, this is perhaps the good. &quot; Now I think &quot;I just know that bitch will take the latest Bagel.&quot;",Ted
21051,You've been too focused on your work.,Robin
21052,"No, it's more than that. I stopped believing. Not like some depressed, I cry during my speech. Not the way I had not even noticed, until tonight. It's just that every day I think I believe a little less and a little less and less. And... it sucks. What should I do about it, Scherbatsky?",Ted
21053,You're Ted Mosby. You do it again to believe it.,Robin
21054,"What, in fate?",Ted

21057,The timing. But the timing is a bitch.,Robin

21085,Lose the cast.,Ted
21086,A one-man show... I love it!,Barney
21087,Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?,Lily
21088,"You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon. I trained all day with these crutches and one who has left in my hall is likely to need it.",Barney

21095,"Guys, this is Garrison Cootes.",Marshall
21096,"If I did not work, I could finish... in kind, a Taco Belle somewhere. And nobody wants that. Unless you want to do this, like this you would have free tacos, since you are my friends. But now I need you all calmiez! (He finally won) Hello.",Marshall

21106,"I just had two rencards following. With two adorable girls, four cappuccinos and wait... (2 minutes later...) I do not know which was the best. Here are the girls: Jessica is a student in Rhode Island, she traveled around the world, speaks four languages and plays the piano. Claire and fought for the bill. So I do not know. It is torture. You see, the two girls have the potential to be really special. They both deserve a second round.",Ted
